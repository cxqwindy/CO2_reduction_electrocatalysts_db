Then the substrate was immersed in a 6 M HCl solution at 70 C for 30 min to eliminate the native oxide. The electrolyte for Cu electrodeposition consisted of 0.12 M CuSO4 5H2O (99.0%, Daejung, Siheung-si, Korea), 0.5 M H2SO4 (95.0%, Junsei, Toyko, Japan), 1.2 M (NH4)2SO4 (99.0%, Alfa Aesar, Haverhill, Massachusetts, USA), and 0.4 mM BTA (98.5%, Daejung).34 Electrodeposition was performed in a conventional three-electrode system composed of the Ti foil as the working electrode, a Pt wire as the counter electrode, and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE, KCl saturated) as the reference electrode. The Ti foil was sealed in a lab-made Teflon cell with an area of 1.13 cm2 exposed to the electrolyte. The Cu foam on the Ti foil substrate was fabricated using two chronopotentiometry steps, at ?2.5 mA/cm2 for 60 s and at ?1200 mA/cm2 for 40 s, which were controlled using a potentiostat (Autolab PGSTAT302N, Metrohm, Herisau, Swiss).

All the electrolytes used to fabricate the Ag/Cu foams were purged by N2 gas (99.995%) flow for 30 min before the experiments. To image the morphologies of the Ag/Cu foams, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, SIGMA, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) was used. The crystal structure was analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD, New D8 Advance, Bruker-AXS, Billerica, Massachusetts, USA). The surface properties of the Ag/Cu foams were investigated using anodic scans in linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) in a 0.1 M KOH solution at a scan rate of 1 mV/s. Electrochemical CO2 conversion by the Ag/Cu foams was performed using an H-type cell (Pine Research Instrumentation, Durham, North Carolina, USA). The cell capacity was 25 mL for both the cathode and anode parts, which were separated by a proton-conducting membrane (Nafion, Wilmington, Delaware, USA NRE-212). The cathode part contained an Ag/Cu foam as a working electrode and an SCE as a reference electrode. The exposed area of the working electrode was fixed at 0.5 cm2. The anode part contained Pt gauze as a counter electrode. KHCO3 (99.5%, Daejung, 0.1 M) at a pH of 6.8 was used for both the catholyte and anolyte, which were purged by N2 gas for 30 min. Then, the catholyte was purged by CO2 gas (99.995%) at a rate of 300 sccm for at least 45 min before the activity measurement. To maintain CO2 saturation during the experiment, CO2 gas was continuously injected into the catholyte at a rate of 10 sccm, ensuring that the product gases entered the sampling loop for gas chromatography (GC, Agilent 7890A). The chronoamperometry method was adopted to analyze the catalytic activity of the Ag/Cu foams at various potentials for 30 min. The CO concentration generated at the cathode was measured by a flame ionization detector (FID) in the GC instrument.

The Cu2+ ions were stabilized by fructose via Cu(OH)-fructose complexation followed by the reduction to Cu2O. However, considering the partial surface oxidation of Cu2O, the nanocubes were designated as Cu2O/CuO. The growth rate, size, and morphology of Cu2O can be tuned by the presence of halides in the solution, where different halides possess different adsorption strengths on the crystal facets of Cu2O [29]. The addition of 1?mL of 10?mM sodium halides (NaCl, NaBr, or NaI) during the synthesis of nanocubes alters the ionic strength of the solution, which affects the growth of Cu adatoms and hence the size of nanocubes [30, 31]. Scheme?1a illustrates the step-wise processes involved in the synthesis of Cu2O/CuO nanocubes. Figure?1a每d displays HR-TEM images of Cu2O/CuO, Cu2O/CuO_Cl, Cu2O/CuO_Br, and Cu2O/CuO_I nanocubes, respectively. The average size of Cu2O/CuO nanocubes was calculated to be 37 ㊣ 3?nm, while the presence of Cl? ions led to the formation of 10?nm smaller Cu2O/CuO_Cl nanocubes.

Figure S1(B) displays the EDS spectrum of the Cu2O/CuO_Cl, Cu2O/CuO_Br, and Cu2O/CuO_I nanocubes. The EDS mapping unambiguously displays the spatial distribution of Cl? ions with at.% of 0.39 on the surface of nanocubes, confirming the specificity of Cl? ion adsorption over the surface of Cu2O. Hence, the growth of Cu2O cubes was ceased by the preferable adsorption of Cl? ions over the surface of Cu2O, which resulted in smaller nanocubes. The adsorbed Cl? ions thermodynamically stabilizes the surface structures and increases the surface area of Cu2O/ CuO_Cl [29, 32]. Random and lower intensities of purple dots were observed in Figure S1(A)b∪ and c∪, which indicates the presence Br? and I? ions without any specific adsorption on the surface of nanocubes. In addition, the at.% of Cl (0.39%) is higher than the Br? (0.20%) and I? (0.31%) elements. Ignaczak et?al. has shown that the decrease in adsorption energy while going from F? to I? on the Cu, Ag and Au metals via density functional theory calculations [33]. XPS is a sensitive technique to gain insight into the surface composition and electronic state of the species. The surface of Cu2O could undergo oxidation in ambient conditions and leave the surface of nanocubes with mixed oxidation states of Cu (such as Cu+ and Cu2+) [34]. Quantification of the relative amount of Cu(II) species on the Cu2O surface could give an insight into the catalytic activity of Cu2O nanocubes [35]. The ratios of Cu (I): Cu(II) was calculated from the Cu2p3/2 spectra using the methodology developed by Gerson and Jaseniak [36]. Figure?2 shows the Cu 2p core level profile XPS spectra of as-synthesized (a) Cu2O/CuO, (b) Cu2O/CuO_Cl, (c) Cu2O/CuO_Br and (d) Cu2O/CuO_I nanocubes.

The main peak present (935.0 and 934.9?eV) in Cu2O/ CuO_Br and Cu2O/CuO_I nanocubes indicates the significant oxide layer over the Cu2O surface. Hence, the availability of Cu2O active sites to the CO2RR has diminished significantly. Cu2O/CuO_Cl nanocubes consist of mainly Cu2O species (80%) with a minor surface CuO phase (20%).

The free-standing PVA/rGO/(Cu2O/CuO_Cl) thin film is stable after twisting, and tape tests, showing its mechanical strength which is one of the desired properties of free-standing working electrodes (Figure S2). In the case of free-standing electrodes, no direct support of the current collector is used; hence the intrinsic electrical conductivity of thin films itself needs to be high enough to conduct the electrons. Electrical conductivity of PVA/rGO/(Cu2O/CuO), PVA/rGO/(Cu2O/CuO_Cl), PVA/rGO/(Cu2O/CuO_Br), and PVA/rGO/(Cu2O/CuO_I), films were measured to be 0.160, 0.182, 0.185 and 0.380 S/m via two probe-method, respectively. These conductivity values are four orders of magnitude lower than that of the reported rGO (2420 S/m) and 30 times lower than the rGO/PVA [39, 40]. The presence of non-conducting PVA on to the rGO sheets could decrease the conductivity of the free-standing thin films.",1

Cu2O/CuO nanocubes were synthesized in the presence of sodium halides (1?mL of 10?mM NaCl, NaBr and NaI) at room temperature. Cl? ion adsorption over the surface of Cu2O hindered the adsorption of adatoms to Cu2O crystal facets and formed 27 ㊣ 2?nm size particles, whereas Br? and I? ions did not show notable adsorption on Cu2O surface and yielded the particles with larger sizes, 62 ㊣ 4 and 207 ㊣ 3?nm, respectively. The high-resolution photoelectron spectrum revealed a small CuO surface phase present over the Cu2O nanocubes. The ratio of Cu2O: CuO for (a) Cu2O/CuO, (b) Cu2O/CuO_Cl, (c) Cu2O/CuO_Br and (d) Cu2O/CuO_I was calculated to be 87:13, 80:20, 34:66 and 35:65.

The FE for methanol and H2 gas were found to be 63 and 20% at ??0.75?V vs RHE, respectively, which is the highest FE among the 每?0.75, ??0.80 and ??0.85?V vs. RHE. With the advantages of low-cost, flexibility, high mechanical strength, catalytic activity, and stability, the free-standing thin films prepared through direct evaporation assisted self-assembly method holds great potential for the use in electrocatalysis and chemical industries to generate pure methanol.",1

The catalysts prepared with various concentrations of different salts are named as Cu(II)Sn(x)y, where x indicates the valence of Sn ions (II or IV) and y is the weight percentage (%) of Sn salt with respect to Cu one. In a typical synthesis (Scheme S1 in the Supporting Information), 900 mg of Cu salt and a certain amount of Sn salt were dissolved in 20 mL of EG to form solution 1, and 1280 mg of NaOH was dissolved in 24 mL of EG and 4 mL of H2O to form solution 2. Then, solution 2 was added into solution 1 drop by drop. After 10 min of vigorous agitation, the mixture was then transferred into a Teflon vessel (volume 100 mL). The Teflon vessel was put in a microwave oven (Milestone STARTSynth, Milestone Inc., Shelton, Connecticut) and connected to pressure and temperature probes. The mixture was irradiated for 10 min at 180 C (Max. 900 W) and then was cooled to ambient temperature. The precipitate was separated by centrifuge and washed twice with H2O and once with ethanol. The powder sample was finally obtained by vacuum drying at 60 C overnight.

After that, the pretreated copper foils were put into a saturated solution of CuSO4 at 80? ～C for 1?h, 2?h, and 4?h. Then, the copper foils were placed in hot water at 80?～C for 2?h, and the water was changed several times to remove the CuSO4 on the surface of the copper foils.

10.1007/s11144-021-02047-z,"Cu2O film electrodes were prepared using an improved solution immersion method, and ZnO nanoparticles were attached to Cu2O film electrodes using an electrodeposition method. All the electrodes were characterized and used for electrocatalytic reduction of CO2. The pure Cu2O film electrode obtained by immersing and reacting in saturated CuSO4 solution for 2?h had a more uniform particle distribution, and its CH3OH yield was the highest in the pure Cu2O film electrodes, indicating that Cu(I) species may have a good selectivity to CH3OH in CO2 reduction, and significantly improved the electrode activity. In contrast, the Cu(II) sites were more prone to hydrogen evolution, which inhibited the reduction of CO2. The ZnO/Cu2O film electrode prepared under the condition of a Zn2+ concentration of 0.05?M and with the deposition time of 30?min had a very high CH3OH formation rate of 52.609?米mol/ (cm2 h), and the Faradaic efficiency reached 45%, both of which were significantly higher than other electrodes. The experimental results indicated that the appropriate Zn2+ concentration and deposition time produced ZnO with uniform shape, distribution, and large specific surface area, thereby enhancing the CO2 adsorption capacity of electrodes. Moreover, the addition of ZnO helped the intermediate products of CO2 reduction to be better fixed on Cu2O. The fundamental reaction mechanisms of CO2 reduction to form CH3OH on the surface of pure Cu2O and ZnO/Cu2O films were also elucidated, which included the transfer of CO2, reduction of CO2 to intermediate product, and proton transfer to H3CO to form CH3OH. The results of this paper provided a relatively reasonable explanation for the electrocatalytic reduction performance of pure Cu2O and ZnO/Cu2O films, and provided some new schemes for the preparation of electrodes for electrocatalytic reduction of CO2.",1

The typical procedure is as follows: 40 mg PVP, 25 mg CTAB, and 50 mL EG were placed into a three-necked flask under constant magnetic stirring (300 r?min每1) and heated in an oil bath. When the temperature reached 140～C, 9 mL of 0.11 mol?L每1 Cu(CH3COO)2 solution was injected. The mixture was heated to 170～C and maintained for 10 min under continuous stirring. The color of the mixture solution changed from deep blue to dark green, indicating the formation of Cu2O.

The obtained precipitates were dried at 60～C for 24 h in a vacuum oven. For the synthesis of Ag/Cu2O, the Cu2O spheres were not separated from the solution. In one pot, the required amount of AgNO3 solution was added to the Cu2Ocontaining mother solution at 170～C. The mixture was stirred for another 10 min, during which the color of the solution changed from dark green to deep gray. Finally, the suspension was centrifuged and the obtained solid was dried under the same conditions as mentioned above. The Ag content of the Ag/Cu2O composites was tuned by varying the concentration of the AgNO3 solution. The samples are denoted as Agx/Cu2O, where x represents the atomic ratio of Ag to Cu added to the reaction mixture. The obtained products are accordingly denoted as Ag0.125/ Cu2O, Ag0.25/Cu2O, Ag0.5/Cu2O, and Ag1/Cu2O.

First, Cu2O nanospheres, with a uniform particle size of ~180 nm, were prepared. Thereafter, Ag/Cu2O composites were fabricated by using Cu2O as a sacrificial template. By varying the Ag/ Cu atomic ratio, a Ag0.125/Cu2O composite possessing a hierarchical flower-like nanostructure with intersecting Ag nanoflakes encompassing an inner Cu2O sphere were prepared. The catalytic performance in the ERC was evaluated in terms of the FE of each product and current density. In comparison with the Cu2O nanospheres, the Ag/ Cu2O samples all present a higher FECO and somewhat suppressed H2 evolution due to the combination of the catalytic ability of Ag combined with Cu2O. Notably, Ag0.125/Cu2O exhibited the highest CO evolution rate as a result of the hierarchical structure, which provides a larger electroactive surface area. The obtained Au0.6/Cu2O composite with the same flower-like structure presented superior catalytic performance with a 10% higher FECO. Importantly, the results reveal that Ag0.125/Cu2O and Au0.6/Cu2O exhibit remarkably improved stability over that of Cu2O.

Figure 1(a) shows the SEM image of the CuTCNQ thin film, showing that it consists of closely packed horizontally aligned micro rods. As can be seen in the images under a larger magnification (Fig. 1(b)), the micro rods are composed of bundles of smaller rods with diameters in the several hundred-nanometer range.

10.1007/s12274-017-1936-1,"A Cu electrode modified with ultra-small Cu nanoparticles (~ 4 nm diameter) embedded in N-doped carbon arrays was fabricated using CuTCNQ arrays as a sacrificial template. The Cu@NC modified electrode enables highly controlled CO2 reduction to CO and formate in DMF (0.1 M Bu4NPF6) containing 0.5 vol% H2O and maintains stable catalytic activity for over 6 h under electrolytic conditions. The water content in the DMF electrolyte medium acts as the sole proton source for CO2 reduction, with a higher water content leading to the formation of more formate and hydrogen, and less CO. Under optimized conditions at 每2.4 V vs. Fc/Fc+ with 0.5 vol% water, a product distribution of 64% formate, 20% CO, and 13% H2 was obtained, which was rationalized by the competition of the CO and formate formation pathways. The CO-forming pathway lacks efficiency at low applied potential because the formation of *C2O4?每 is not thermodynamically favorable. However, at more negative potentials, the polarizable CO2﹞每 radical anion electrostatically interacts with the negative charge on the electrode surface. Control experiments and post-electrolysis analysis showed that the significantly higher catalytic current density and improved product selectivity of the Cu@NC array electrode could be attributed to its 3D micro structure and Cu nanoparticles embedded in the NC. This study demonstrates the potential for improving electrocatalytic CO2 reduction efficiency through structural design of the catalyst. Finally, it is worth noting that this bottom-up synthetic method is applicable to other metal substrates, such as Ag, Ni and Zn [46, 47], that can spontaneously react with TCNQ to form nanostructured metal-TCNQ.",1

After annealing at 350 ～C, the Cu(OH)2 turned to CuO, as confirmed by the change of XRD patterns before and after annealling (Fig. S1 in the Electronic Supplementary Material (ESM)). The subsequent electrochemical reduction led to the formation of metallic Cu array, as evidenced by both XPS and XRD characterizations (Figs. S1 and S2 in the ESM). The SEM image confirmed the morphology of NW array after electrochemical reduction (Fig. 2(a)). The width of the nanowire was ~ 100 nm as revealed by TEM characterization of a single Cu wire peeled off from the array electrode (Fig. 2(b)). HRTEM showed obvious grain boundaries on the surface of Cu nanowire, suggesting polycrystalline nature of Cu NW (Fig. 2(c)) and the selected area electron diffraction results further confirmed its polycrystalline feature (Fig. S3 in the ESM). The electrode assembled by arrayed Cu NWs showed a superaerophobic surface, as evidenced by a contact angle of 154.4～ for CO2 gas bubbles on such a Cu array surface (Fig. 2(d)). Meanwhile, the contact angle for the 0.1 M KHCO3 aqueous solution (i.e. CO2RR electrolyte) was 32.9～, revealing a hydrophilic state. This aerophobic surface nature facilitated the leaving of gas products thus giving a stable current density (Fig. 2(e)). However, when immersing the Cu NW array electrode in a 5% PTFE solution, a thin layer of PTFE was uniformly coated on the surface of Cu NWs (Fig. 2(b) and Fig. S4 in the ESM), which changed the affinity towards gaseous CO2 and electrolyte significantly (Fig. 2(f)). Meanwhile, both the Cu NW array structure and the surface electronic structure were maintained (Figs. S5 and S6 in the ESM). The contact angles for CO2 gas bubbles and electrolytes were measured to be 48.4～ and 136.6～, respectively, suggesting the surface turned from aerophobic/hydrohpilic to aerophilic/hydrophobic state. Such a gas affinitive surface would lead to a stronger bubble adhesion, and hold the gaseous products for a longer time during electrochemical CO2RR process. Thus, the bubbles were kept on the electrode surface till the size got bigger than 1 mm or more. When the size of product bubbles got large enough to detach, the working surface area recovered at the sudden moment of bubble releasing. Repeated accumulation and release caused fluctuations of current with sharp jump and steady decay (Fig. 2(g)).",1

The addition of PEI is carried out afterwards and the resulting mixture is finally heated (at 60 oC) and stirred for, at least, 2 h. The solution is then stirred overnight and then, vacuum is applied for approximately 1 h. The spinning process (spinneret with inner and outer diameters of 0.8 mm and 2 mm, respectively) is performed at room temperature using a stainless steel vessel. A coagulation bath is utilised to collect the fibres once the mixture is pressed through the spinneret while deionized water is pumped (30 mlmin-1) through the bore of the spinneret. The distance between the spinneret outlet and the coagulation bath level (i.e. air gap) is set at around 1 cm. The obtained Cu HFs are kept into the coagulation bath for 24 h in order to remove NMP traces. After the drying step at room temperature for 1 day, the fibres are thermally treated at 600 oC for 3 h to remove traces of PEI as well as for Cu sintering, resulting in a porous CuO HF.

The pattern showed the existence of only the Cu2O phase with no secondary phases from CuO or Cu metal, confirming that the short residence time within the first CJM was sufficient to form pure-phase Cu2O. The sharp peaks indicated the particles were crystalline in nature and the application of the Scherrer equation resulted in a crystallite size of 35 nm. Surface analysis of the Cu2O sample showed the existence of Cu2O (peak 2p3/2 at 932.3 eV) but also the presence of CuO phase, as confirmed from the satellite peaks and the presence of the 2p3/2 peak at 934.8 eV corresponding to CuO (Figure 2 b)). The existence of CuO in the surface analysis suggests the presence of an amorphous CuO layer on the surface of the Cu2O nanoparticles, which was likely not seen in the XRD due to its amorphous nature. This is expected as the surface undergoes oxidation from Cu2O to form amorphous CuO due to the unstable Cu + oxidation state. As-synthesised nano-powders were also characterised by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Figure 2 c)) where round crystalline nanoparticles were observed. Bersani et al. synthesized CuO nanoparticles using CHFS where the nanoparticles were crystalline with diameter of 11 ㊣ 4 nm from TEM [14]. The electrochemical behaviour of the as-prepared Cu2O nanoparticles was subsequently examined to evaluate the performance of Cu2O nanoparticles for CO2 conversion.",1

The aluminum-copper-indium (Al73Cu25In2,) ternary precursors were prepared by an arc melting furnace under argon atmosphere at a pressure of 4.8℅10-4 Pa (Anhui Jiao Shuo Incorporation, China). The alloy ingots were subsequently solidified rapidly by single roller melt-spinning into the ribbons with a thickness of 15-20 米m. The np-Cu-In was made by chemical dealloying of the precursor by corroding the ribbon in 5 wt.% HCl solution at room temperature for 24 hours.[25,26] The resultant nanoporous product was rinsed by deionized water and alcohol in sequential order to remove residual chemicals. Nanoporous sample was attached on copper tape as current collector, and the marginal region uninterested was sealed by the silicone in favor of calculating geometrical area of the electrode. 2.2 Electrochemical training of the np-Cu-In",1
10.1016/j.electacta.2018.11.101,"Prior to Ag displacement, In was electrodeposited onto commercial In foil (Figure 1a) at a constant deposition current of ?1000 mA/cm2 for 1800 s in an electrolyte composed of 10 mM InCl3 and 500 mM HClO4 (Figure 1b). Micrometer-scale polygonal shapes were obtained that exhibited continuous morphologies with numerous holes, consistent with literature reports [39]. The In deposits were then immersed in an electrolyte composed of 10 mM AgNO3 and 10 mM 2- nitrobenzoic acid. Due to the different standard reduction potentials (In3+/In0: ?0.34 VNHE and Ag+/Ag0: +0.79 VNHE), Ag displacement occurred spontaneously [36]. We introduce the following nomenclature for the prepared catalysts: ※Ag#/In§, where ※#§ refers to the Ag displacement time (s). In the FESEM image of Ag60/In (Figure 1c), a number of Ag particles are observed to be sparsely formed on the surfaces of the In polygons. The Ag-particle density and coverage continued to increase with displacement time, to 300 s (Ag300/In, Figure 1d) and 600 s (Ag600/In, Figure 1e). Exposed In was barely visible, but still existed in the Ag600/In sample, as shown in the inset of Figure 1e. A further increase in Ag displacement time to 1200 s led to morphological changes that resulted in hierarchical nanoplates with high coverage over the surfaces of the In polygons (Figure 1f). at room temperature. Figure 3c shows the XPS spectra of the Ag#/In samples. The In 3d peak intensity was observed to continuously decrease with increasing Ag displacement time, whereas the Ag 3d peak intensity gradually increased, consistent with increasing Ag composition of the surface. The binding energies of Ag 3d5/2 peaks for all Ag#/In samples were 368.2 eV, which was identical with that for commercial Ag foil as a reference. The metallic state of Ag showed that the electronic structure of Ag was not changed even though the electrodeposited In and displaced Ag are adjacent to each other because the electronegativity of Ag and In are similar (Ag: 1.9 and In: 1.8). The In 3d peaks could be deconvoluted into In0 and In3+ peaks (Figure S1). The presence of In3+ peak might be originated from the native oxide layer. The In3+ peak intensity was decreased by increase of Ag displacement time because the exposed area of In was decreased. Based on the EDS and XPS analyses, the Ag compositions of the Ag#/In samples are summarized in Figure 3d according to Ag displacement times. The Ag compositions determined by XPS are much higher than those determined by EDS, verifying that Ag was formed on the In surface. The double layer capacitances were measured by repeated CV varying scan rate in 0.5 M KHCO3 electrolyte as shown in Figure S2 and S3. The double layer capacitance of electrodeposited In was 36.0 米F/cm2. After the Ag displacement, the value was increased with Ag#/In samples in the range of 51.0 ~ 105.0 米F/cm2, affected by their surface morphologies of displaced Ag (Figure 1b-f).",1

GNFs are grown using a thermal plasma method following Pristavita＊s procedure.[30] Methane is injected in an inductively coupled thermal plasma (ICP) torch where molecules are decomposed into carbon and hydrogen atoms by the argon thermal plasma (typically 10,000 K in the main plasma zone). The ICP torch is connected to a water-cooled axisymmetric reactor with a conical expansion that allows a well-controlled flow line pattern and cooling of the plasma during expansion. This enables homogeneous nucleation of the atomic carbon precursor and growth of the specific GNF structures within a temperature window modeled to be between 4,900 K down to 3,700 K. The high temperature of the nucleation region and the extended residence time in the growth region enabled by the system geometry generate GNF structures with exceptional crystallinity downstream of the ICP torch (Figure 1).[31] The GNFs are deposited on the walls by thermophoretic forces and on the downstream collection plate of the reactor. A small flow of nitrogen (0.1 slpm) is typically added during the growth procedure along with methane, leading to a nitrogen functionalization content up to 2 at% on the surface of the GNFs.

10.1016/j.jcis.2020.03.017,"The micro-strains inside the catalysts were introduced by a facile, fast cooling approach. In brief, copper oxide (CuO) nanoparticles were first synthesized and annealed at a high temperature (500 oC), and then was cooled down at different rates under various cooling environments (Figure 1a). For the super-fast cooling rate, the CuO nanoparticles were cooled in liquid N2 (?196 oC) to obtain the target catalyst, named CuO-FC (where FC indicates fast cooling rate). For comparison, the CuO nanoparticles were also cooled down by water (i.e., medium cooling rate, designated as CuO-MC) or hot air (i.e., slow cooling rate, designated as CuO-SC). The crystalline phases of these obtained samples were first characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Figure 2a). All the three samples presented sharp diffraction peaks that were characteristic for the crystal structure of monoclinic CuO (PDF: 89-5895). No clear 6 differences were observed in the peak positions. This result suggested that the different cooling treatments did not alter their phases or crystal structures. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed that all these CuO samples were composed of many interconnected irregularly nano-crystallines, with average sizes of ~ 50 nm (Figure 2b-d). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images exhibited similar nano-crystalline morphologies of these samples. However, a slight decrease of the particle size was observed with the increase of the cooling rate (Figure 2e-g, Figure S1). This slight reduction of particle size may be possibly ascribed to the fact that the fast cooling rate can limit the atomic transfer rate in the Ostwald Ripening process, and thus impede the material growth.27 In addition, many GBs were clearly observed in these small CuO nanoparticles. The CuO-FC sample presented a highest density of these GBs (as shown in red dashed box in Fig. 2g). As reported by previous literature,21 this high density of GBs was beneficial for transforming into a grainboundary-rich (GB-rich) Cu crystal structure during the subsequent electrochemical reduction of CuO. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was then conducted to further study the electronic structures of these samples. For the Cu 3d spectra (Figure 2h), the peaks at ca. 954.2 and 934.1 eV corresponded to the 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 of CuO.28 The three peaks of 962.3, 944.0 and 941.5 eV were assigned to the satellite signals of Cu2+.28 The O 1s spectrum can be de-convoluted into two distinct sub-peaks at 531.8 and 530.0 eV (Figure 2i), which were ascribed to the surface oxygen and lattice oxygen in CuO.29 The XPS results suggest that no clear electron transfer was observed between Cu and neighboring atoms.30 The atomic ratios between Cu and O elements in the three CuO samples were listed (Table S1). In addition, the ratios of the lattice oxygen and surface oxygen were 1.3, 1.33, and, 1.43, respectively (Table S2). The results indicated that no obvious oxygen vacancies existed, and were different from previous work of oxygen vacancies in TiO2.29, 31 This phenomenon difference can be attributed to the lower oxygen vacancy formation energy in TiO2.32 In addition, the lattice strains induced by alloying or lattice mismatch at epitaxial interfaces typically show an obvious shift of 7 the shell electron energy.33-35 However, the micro-strains are more associated with surface or bulk defects and thus do not present such a trend.36 To investigate the micro-strains by different cooling treatments, XRD collected using synchrotron light source (SXRD) was further conducted to measure these samples (Figure 3a-c). The two-theta XRD patterns derived from the SXRD results were displayed (Figure S2), and the plane distances were calculated by using Bragg equation 2dsin牟 = n竹, which were consistent with the results of the aforementioned 2- dimensional XRD (Figure 2a). The data of the SXRD were analyzed using Williamson?Hall analysis.18, 21 The scatters corresponded to each peak of the CuO samples were displayed (Figure 3d). A linear fitting was obtained and attributed to the following correlation: Bcos牟 = K竹/D + 4e*sin牟, where D is the average crystallite size, 竹 is the wavelength, e is the non-uniform strain (micro-strain), and the Scherrer constant K = 1.18, 21 The slopes of the linear fitting represented the micro-strains, and the crystallite sizes were calculated from the intercepts. The linear fitting results were summarized (Figure 3e), which showed an increasing slope with the cooling rate increase. Thus, CuO-FC exhibited the largest micro-strains. Meanwhile, CuO-FC also presented the largest intercept of the linear fittings, indicating the smallest crystallite size. The detailed fitting results of these three CuO samples were summarized (Table S3). The average sizes of the CuO-SC, CuO-MC and CuO-FC nanoparticles were 40.5, 35.8 and 35.3 nm, respectively. The effect of tuning the micro-strains and GBs in the CuO catalysts on the ECR performance was then investigated. Due to the low solubility of CO2 in aqueous solutions, the conventional H-type electrochemical cell can only have limited activities.37 In addition, the longer mass transportation path made the lower overpotential reaction of HER easier.38 Thus, the flow-cell with gas-diffusion layer (GDL) and high alkaline (1 M KOH) were used instead. About 0.25 mg﹞cm-2 of CuO catalyst was loaded onto the GDL. Before the ECR measurement, all the three CuO catalysts were electrochemically reduced to form pure copper (Figure S3). TEM images show that all the Cu catalysts were homogeneously dispersed on the edge of 8 porous carbon (Figure S4). High-resolution TEM images show that there was little reconstruction of catalysts, with the GBs still being clearly observed. Different orientations of Cu (100) and (110) were observed (Figure S4d), suggesting that different crystallite domains co-existed to form micro-strains. The electrochemical performances of these samples were first investigated by measuring the cyclic voltammetry (CV) profiles. The results displayed characteristic peaks between ?0.3 and 0.5 V vs. RHE (Figure S5). The positive potential could be attributed to the reduce reaction of Cu2+ to Cu,38 and the negative potential was the water splitting into the hydrogen. The ECR activity was then measured under different applied potentials between ? 0.3 and ?1.2 V (vs. RHE, with iR-correction). For CuOSC, CuO-MC and CuO-FC, different products selectivity distribution of each electrocatalyst were displayed versus the applied potential (Figure 4a-c). The comparison of different samples was conducted within the limited potential difference. It can be seen that the H2 formation was maintained low with the FEs of < 20%, partially attributed to the pH effect in a high alkaline electrolyte.38 For all these three catalysts, CO, C2H4 and C2H5OH were the main ECR products. The ECR total current densities were close to 300 mA cm-2 at about ?1.0 V vs. RHE. The onset potentials of C2 products (C2H4 and C2H5OH) were relatively more negative than those of C1 products, as the C?C coupling process is generally more sluggish.40 The partial current densities of C2 products were 246.3 (for CuO-MC) and 240.8 mA﹞cm-2 (for CuO-FC). The densities were 1.31 and 1.29 times higher than that of CuO-SC (186.9 mA﹞cm-2). In addition, a clear difference of ethanol (C2H5OH) and ethylene (C2H4) was also observed. CuO-FC presented an FE as high as 35.7% for ethanol production with a partial current density of 127.2 mA﹞cm-2. In contrast, CuO-MC exhibited an FE of only 18.6% for ethanol production, but with a partial current density of 179.9 mA﹞cm-2 for producing ethylene (Table S4-S6). The Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) of the total C2 products of different samples were further plotted with the applied potentials (Figure 4d). When the potential was less negative than ?0.6 V, CuO-SC possessed a relatively high FE of C2 products. This is 9 because more unsaturated Cu sites in the smaller particle sizes of Cu-MC and Cu-FC resulted in higher H2 production at this potential range.41 At more negative applied potentials when the thermodynamic energy became more dominating for C?C coupling, both CuO-MC and CuO-FC showed better selectivities for C2 products at this potential range. The ratios between C2 and C1 products were displayed to show this trend (Figure 4e). In spite that CuO-FC had similar partial current densities for C2 formation as those of CuO-MC, the CuO-FC sample presented the largest ratios between C2 and C1 products in most of the potentials. For example, at ?0.8 V vs. RHE, the ratio between C2 and C1 products was 7.04 for CuO-FC, substantially exceeding that of CuO-MC (4.48) and CuO-SC (2.00). This clear increase of C2 product formation suggests that micro-strains induced by fast cooling rate can help to stabilize the main intermediate toward C2 production, that is, *CO,37 and thus the subsequent C?C coupling steps. Moreover, the ratios between ethanol and C2H4 products were further compared among these three catalysts (Figure 4f). It can be seen that CuO-FC presented the highest ratio between ethanol and C2H4, with a peak value of 1.4 at ?0.85 V vs. RHE. As suggested by recent literatures,42, 43 the improvement of *CO adsorption can lead to a higher surface coverage of *CO intermediate, favoring the subsequent oxygenate formation toward ethanol. To confirm our findings, we conducted another set of experiments by first reduced the CuO nanoparticles into Cu at high temperature, followed by fast cooling (using liquid nitrogen) or slow cooling (using natural room temperature), designated as CuFC and Cu-SC, respectively. XRD and corresponding Williamson-Hall analysis also demonstrated a similar trend that the Cu-FC obtained from fast cooling showed a higher density of micro-strains (Figure S6). The electrochemical CO2 reduction measurement using these catalysts demonstrated results of increased C2 products by fast-cooling Cu catalyst (Figure S7), similar to those of aforementioned CuO ones. Simultaneously, CuO (800)-FC was obtained by the same treatment with CuO annealed at 800 oC, which showed no obvious performance enhancement compared to CuO-FC (Figure S8). It demonstrated that a higher annealing temperature led a reduction of active sites.18",1

The formation of these pores maybe caused by the large amount of overflowing H2 generated while reducing Ag+ and Cu2+ by KBH4. The three-dimensional porous network structure is the most important feature of aerogel materials[38] suggesting the successful preparation of our Ag-Cu bimetallic aerogel. Compared with onedimensional and two-dimensional materials, aerogel has unique advantages in catalysis. The large number of pores in Ag88Cu12 can supply more reaction sites for eCO2RR, and provide transfer channels for unreacted CO2 and generated CO to facilitate the diffusion of gas molecules, which favors its high activity and selectivity. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) further illustrates the successful synthesis of aerogel materials. Aerogel has three types of linkage: (1) bridge, applying to that the average size of the particle joint is smaller than the particle diameter, (2) ligament (size equal to the particle diameter) and (3) island (size larger than particle diameter)[39]. It is confirmed from Fig. 1e that Ag88Cu12 aerogel is composed of nanoparticles connected by ligaments with a porous network structure.

Results and Discussion As shown in Fig. 1a, CuS nanoflowers composed of nanosheets were synthesized by solvothermal method at 150 ～C in EG, with the feed ratio of Cu/S at 1:3. All the diffraction peaks in XRD pattern (Fig. 1b) can be indexed to the covellite CuS phase (PDF 06-0464). HR-TEM image shows the lattice spacing of the primary nanosheet in CuS nanoflowers was 2.8 ? (Fig. 1c), which matches the (103) plane of hexagonal covellite phase. Fig. 1d is the EDX spectra of CuS nanoflowers, demonstrating that they are comprised of Cu and S. To further identify the valence states of Cu and S, XPS analysis was performed. As shown in the Cu 2p XPS spectrum (Fig. 1e), the peaks at 932.5 eV and 952.5 eV can be assigned to Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2, together with the absence of shake-up satellite peaks, indicate Cu exists in +1 state. The S 2p peak can be deconvoluted to S2-, S2- and high valence S complex [13], respectively, as shown in Fig. 1f. The effect of Cu/S feed ratio and reaction temperature on copper sulfide formation were then 4 investigated. When Cu/S feed ratio was lowered from 1:3 to 1:0.75, copper sulfide with triangular plate morphology was formed (Fig. 2a). XRD analysis indicates other than covellite CuS, there also exists monoclinic Cu7S4 phase (PDF 23-0958), as shown in Fig. 2b. EDX measurement reveals that the average Cu/S atomic ratio of triangular plate was 1.45 (Cu1.45S). Furthermore, reaction temperature also influences copper sulfide formation. When the reaction temperature was increased from 150 ～C to 180 ～C, the obtained products maintain nanoflower-like morphology (Fig. 2c), but XRD analysis identified the existence of orthogonal Cu7S4 (PDF 33-0489) impurity phase (Fig. 2d). EDX result shows that the average Cu/S atomic ratio is 1.54 (Cu1.54S). These results indicate that both Cu/S feed ratio and reaction temperature are important experimental parameters for synthesizing pure covellite CuS nanoflowers. CuCl2 and Tu are known to form a Cu-Tu complex [14], which acts as actual precursor for synthesizing CuS under solvothermal conditions. Therefore, the Tu/Cu feed molar ratio should be high enough in order to obtain pure CuS phase, otherwise Cu-rich phase would be formed. In addition, high reaction temperature is required to pyrolyze Cu-Tu complex into CuS. However, when the reaction temperature exceeds certain threshold, due to the reducing power of EG, the formed CuS might be further reduced to Cu-rich phases such as Cu7S4, consistent with our previous observations [15]. The electrochemical performances of copper sulfides precatalysts in the CO2 reduction reaction were evaluated in an H-type cell (Fig. 3a) using a standard three-electrode system. Taking CuS nanoflowers as an example, they were first electrochemically reduced to SD-Cu, which showed very little morphological changes (Fig. S1). The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was then conducted on SD-Cu to evaluate its electrochemical activity. As shown in Fig. 3b, the current density in CO2-saturated 0.1 M KHCO3 was larger than that in N2-saturated solution, suggesting SD-Cu is more 5 favorable for CO2 reduction reaction than hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Under all applied potentials (-0.6 V, -0.8 V, -1.0 V and -1.2 V vs. RHE), the current densities displayed good stability (Fig. 3c). The performance of SD-Cu was quantitatively evaluated by calculating the FEHCOOH through analyzing the liquid-phase products after 2 h of potentiostatic electrolysis. From Fig. 3d, it can be seen that the FEHCOOH of SD-Cu originating from CuS nanoflowers can reach approximately 52% at -0.8 V ~ -1.0 V. In comparison, when Cu1.54S nanoflowers and Cu1.45S nanoplates were used as precatalysts, the FEHCOOH can only reach 37.5% and 24.2% (Fig. S2), respectively. Therefore, the selectivity of HCOOH depends both on the sulfur content and morphology of copper sulfides precatalysts. During the electrochemical reduction of copper sulfides to metallic Cu, S2- ions were released into the electrolyte and absorbed on the surface of Cu catalysts, which suppressed the formation of other hydrocarbon products and resulted in the high selectivity towards HCOOH during CO2 electroreduction [16]. The high S content in copper sulfides precatalysts might lead to more S2- ions absorbed on Cu surface and thus achieve higher FEHCOOH. To verify this hypothesis, we conducted a series of experiments using copper foil as the working electrode, with various amounts of K2S added in the KHCO3 electrolyte. It was found that the FEHCOOH of copper gradually increased with increasing K2S concentrations (Fig. S3). This is in agreement with the results that S-rich CuS has higher FEHCOOH compared to other Cu-rich copper sulfide counterparts. 4. Conclusions In summary, copper sulfide nanocrystals have been synthesized via a simple solvothermal method in ethylene glycol, with their morphology and composition varied by tuning the Cu/S feed ratio and reaction temperature. When being applied to the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to HCOOH, CuS nanoflowers exhibited the best FE (~ 52%) due to its high S content and specific morphology, 6 compared to their more Cu-rich counterparts. This study demonstrates copper sulfide composition and morphology are important tuning parameters for optimized HCOOH production via CO2 electrochemical reduction, which should be considered for future catalyst design.

10.1016/j.nanoen.2016.03.024,"To prepare p-NG-Cu, 30 mg p-NG was first dispersed in 10 ml isopropanol t 20 ml hexane under ultrasonication for 30 min, and then 30 mg of Cu NPs dispersed in hexane was added dropwise into the dispersion. The mixture was kept sonicated for 1 h. The catalyst was separated by centrifugation and washed with ethanol and DI water. To remove the surfactant, the as-obtained p-NG-Cu catalyst was suspended in 60 mL n-butylamine and stirred for three days under N2 atmosphere at ambient temperature. The mixture was separated by centrifugation and washed with ethanol and DI water to obtain the final catalyst. The Cu mass loadings in p-NG-Cu-7 at different p-NG/Cu mass ratios were measured to be 39% (1:2), 35% (1:1), 23% (2:1), and 12% (4:1) as analyzed by ICPAES. The Cu mass loadings in p-NG-Cu-13 were measured to be 39% (1:1), 28% (2:1), and 12% (4:1). GO-Cu (or C每Cu) (mass ratio of 1:1) was prepared similarly. The Cu mass loading in GO-Cu (or C每 Cu) was measured to be 36% (or 38%).",1
10.1016/j.nanoen.2016.03.024,"Monodisperse Cu NPs were synthesized by reductive decomposition of copper(I) acetate, CuAc, in trioctylamine and tetradecylphosphonic acid (TDPA) at 250 ～C [21]. In the synthesis, mixing 1 mmol CuAc with 0.5 mmol TDPA gave 7 nm Cu and reacting 1 mmol CuAc with 1 mmol TDPA produced 13 nm Cu NPs. Fig. 1A and B shows the transmission electron microcopy (TEM) image of the 7 nm (7.470.4 nm) (Fig. 1A) and 13 nm (13.170.6 nm) Cu NPs (Fig. 1B). The representative Cu NPs were further characterized by HRTEM (Fig. 1C and D). The HRTEM images show the lattice fringes with the inter-fringe distance of 0.21 nm, corresponding to the (111) plane of the face-centered cubic (fcc) Cu. The multiple crystal domains and the surface disordering observed from the images also indicate the as-synthesized NPs are in polycrystalline and the surface Cu may have been oxidized.",1
