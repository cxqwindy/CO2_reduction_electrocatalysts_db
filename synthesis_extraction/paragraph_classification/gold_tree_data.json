The starting Cu solution contained Cu(acac)2, oleylamine (OAm), and diphenyl ether (DPE). A Schlenk line was used to evacuate the flask and to introduce CO gas. The temperature was slowly ramped to 220? \uff5eC (1.6? \uff5eC min?1) and held for 2 h. The vessel was then cooled to 30? \uff5eC. A portion of the NPs, labeled as CuCore, was taken at this point for characterization. For the formation of Cu@Ag NPs, a solution of AgOCOCF3 dissolved in OAm was slowly injected (1?mg Ag h?1) to the CuCore suspension at 30?\uff5eC while CO was flowing. The injection lasted 10 h and the mixture was stirred for an additional 12 h to ensure uniform growth of the Ag-enriched shell.[69,70] The CuCore and Cu@Ag NPs were collected by centrifugation, washed with hexane and methanol, and dispersed in hexane for further use. Figure? 1b is a proposed atomic scheme for the formation of the Cu@Ag NPs through the process outlined in Figure?1a. Figure?2 analyzes the ultraviolet-visible (UV\u6bcfvis) absorption spectra of the Cu@Ag NPs after different durations of time for the addition of silver using the characteristic UV\u6bcfvis peaks for Cu (580? nm) and Ag (410? nm). The Ag peak, which was initially absent, appeared after the reaction for 3 h, and significantly increased after 10 h. This observation suggests an increase in the thickness of the Ag-enriched shell during the reaction process. Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) images show the particles uniformly grew from the 6.5?nm CuCore NPs (Figure?3a) to form Cu@Ag"

The details of the original designs were reported elsewhere.[64,74] The schematic for the typical synthesis is provided in Figure?1a. In a standard procedure, Cu(acac)2 (16?mg) was dissolved in OAm (9?mL) in a three-neck flask. DPE was added at a concentration of 120 \u7c73m. The resulting turquoise-blue solution was placed in an oil bath at 30?\uff5eC and continuously stirred during the following steps. A Schlenk line was purged using Ar gas and applied vacuum with a vacuum pump (Edwards, RV12). Before switching to Ar, the line was held under vacuum for 5? min to remove oxygen gas from the system. This process was repeated six times. Carbon monoxide gas was then introduced at a flow rate of 90 sccm. Caution: CO gas is toxic and should be handled with extra care in a well-vented chemical hood equipped with a CO detector. The temperature was maintained at 30?\uff5eC for 30?min, followed by being heated at a ramp rate of 1.6?\uff5eC min?1 to 220?\uff5eC using an oil bath. The color of the solution changed from transparent blue-green to yellow to reddish-brown during heating. The temperature of the vessel was kept at 220?\uff5eC for 2 h to ensure the completion of the reaction. Afterwards, the vessel was removed from the oil bath, allowed to cool naturally in about 1.5 h, and then placed in a second oil bath at 30? \uff5eC, all while flowing CO. A portion of the NPs, labeled as CuCore, was taken at this point for characterization. The effects of the concentration of DPE on the formation of CuCore NPs were tested at 0, 60, and 120 \u7c73m, respectively, while keeping all other conditions the same."

The mass concentration of the suspension in hexane was determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, Model: Q50) to be approximately 1? mg metal mL?1. Three sets of data were collected by TGA and the average value was used to ensure the accuracy. Next, 10? mg of Ketjen black carbon was added in hexane (0.5? mg C mL?1 hexane) and sonicated for 30? min. The Cu@Ag NP suspension (2? mg of the solid) was added dropwise in \uff1e5?min. The carbon suspension in hexane was continuously stirred during the addition of Cu@Ag NPs and kept on for an additional hour afterwards. The resulting suspension was sonicated for 1 h, and the solids were separated using centrifugation (5000? rpm, 10? min). The particles were then dissolved in butylamine (1? mL mg?1) to remove the organic materials from the surface for electrocatalytic activation.[83,84] This suspension was continuously stirred for 72 h while covered. The solid product was removed from the butylamine solvent by centrifugation (5000? rpm, 10? min) and washed once using hexane. The final Cu@Ag/C electrocatalyst was obtained by drying in Ar gas at room temperature. This synthesis procedure of carbon-supported electrocatalyst was done for three samples: CuCore (120 \u7c73m DPE), Cu@Ag (120 \u7c73m DPE), and Cu@Ag (0 \u7c73m)."

The nanoporous copper were fabricated through the annealing of Cu(OH)2 nanorods and the electrochemical reduction of the nanoporous CuO. Firstly, the Cu(OH)2 nanorods were prepared by a literature method.[54] Typically, 1 g of Cu(NO3)2 is first dissolved in 100 mL distilled water. Then, 30 mL NH3?H2O (0.15 m) solution was added to the Cu(NO3)2 solution under constant stirring at room temperature. A blue precipitate of Cu(OH)2 was produced when dropwise added 10 mL of NaOH (1 m) solution (\uff1e2 mL min?1) to the above solution to adjust the pH value to 9\u6bcf10. After 30 min, the blue Cu(OH)2 precipitate was filtered washed several times to obtain a solid product, and then dried in the vacuum oven for overnight. Secondly, the nanoporous CuO was prepared by annealing the Cu(OH)2 nanorods in the static air atmosphere at 500 \uff5eC for 2 h with a heating rate of 32 \uff5eC min?1. At last, the nanoporous copper was obtained by the electrochemical reduction of nanoporous CuO on GDL at a constant current density of 10 mA cm?2 in the same cell as CO2 reduction, and the corresponding applied voltages of different electrolyte were listed in the Table S7 in the Supporting Information."

Then, 10.0 mL NaOH aqueous solution (2.0 m) was added dropwise into the above solution. After stirring for 30 min, 10.0 mL ascorbic acid solution (0.60 m) was added dropwise into the dark brown solution. The mixture was aged for 3 h and the solution gradually transferred into turbid red. All of the procedure was carried out under constant stirring and heated in a water bath at 55 \uff5eC. The resulting precipitate was collected by centrifugation and decanting, followed by washing with distilled water 3 times and absolute ethanol 3 times and finally dried under vacuum at 60 \uff5eC for 6 h."

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images confirmed the nanowire arrays morphology of the Cu2O/CuO with 200\u6bcf300 nm diameter (Figure 1b) on the surface of Cu foam (Figure S2, Supporting Information). Motivated by the electronic interaction concept that occurs when transition metals hybridized with another transition metal compounds,[10] the Cu2O/CuO@M nanowires (M = Ni, Fe, Co) structures were achieved via a rapid galvanic replacement method in 5 min. Nanoparticles of Ni (Figure 1c), Fe (Figure S3, Supporting Information), and Co (Figure S4, Supporting Information) were uniformly distributed on Cu2O/ CuO nanowires. Compared with the smooth nanowire surface ? 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The presence of Cu2O phase in pristine Cu2O/CuO, Cu2O/ CuO@Co, Cu2O/Cu @Fe, and Cu2O/CuO@Ni nanowires was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses (Figure S5, Supporting Information).

The enlarged XRD spectra in Figure S5b in the Supporting Information show the (200) and (?112) phases of CuO (JCPDS no. 45-0937), suggesting the heterostructure between Cu2O and CuO.

CuO NWs were then fabricated by annealing the Cu(OH)2 NW arrays at 150 8C for 2 hours in air.

Then the resulting solution was heated up to 210 8C quickly and refluxed at this temperature for 1 h before cooling down to room temperature naturally. In order to obtain Cu nanocubes with a larger edge length (44 nm), the content of TOPO was reduced to 7.5 mmol and the content of CuBr to 1.5 mmol dissolved in 35 mL of oleylamine. Then the resulting solution was heated up to 220 8C quickly and refluxed at this temperature for 1 h. In order to obtain Cu nanocubes with a larger edge length (63 nm), the content of TOPO was reduced to 2.5 mmol, while the temperature and the aging time was increased to 2608C and 2.5 h, respectively. Cu NCs spheres were obtained by following similar procedure. For the synthesis of Cu spheres of 27 nm, oleylamine (35 mL) and CuBr (3 mmol) were mixed in a three-necked flask by strong magnetic stirring at 80 8C for 15 min, then TOP (6 mmol) was injected into the obtained green solution, which immediately became colorless.

In addition, weak peaks of cubic Cu2O (111), (200), and (220) planes with a space group of Pn3?m (COD: 1000063) are observed due to oxidation in air or Cu-B interaction with the solvent during synthesis. Similarly, peaks assigned to hexagonal Zn (P63/mmc, COD: 9012435) and ZnO (P63mc, COD: 9008877) are both observed in the XRD pattern of the assynthesized Zn sample (Figure 1 B), with the intensity of the oxide peaks being notably higher compared to B-Cu due to faster oxidation of metallic Zn."

Both the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) (Figure 1e) and the selective area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Figure 1 f) pointed out a highly ordered hexagonal crystalline structure. The energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping analysis shows the uniform distribution of elemental Cu, Cl, F, and O (Figure 1g\u6bcfj).

        "synthesis_paragraph": "Before Cu electrodeposition, a Ti foil substrate (Sejin, 2 \u2105 2 cm2, thickness: 0.1 mm) was ultrasonicated in 30% ethanol solution for 2 min to remove organic residues. Then the substrate was immersed in a 6 M HCl solution at 70 C for 30 min to eliminate the native oxide. The electrolyte for Cu electrodeposition consisted of 0.12 M CuSO4 5H2O (99.0%, Daejung, Siheung-si, Korea), 0.5 M H2SO4 (95.0%, Junsei, Toyko, Japan), 1.2 M (NH4)2SO4 (99.0%, Alfa Aesar, Haverhill, Massachusetts, USA), and 0.4 mM BTA (98.5%, Daejung).34 Electrodeposition was performed in a conventional three-electrode system composed of the Ti foil as the working electrode, a Pt wire as the counter electrode, and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE, KCl saturated) as the reference electrode. The Ti foil was sealed in a lab-made Teflon cell with an area of 1.13 cm2 exposed to the electrolyte. The Cu foam on the Ti foil substrate was fabricated using two chronopotentiometry steps, at ?2.5 mA/cm2 for 60 s and at ?1200 mA/cm2 for 40 s, which were controlled using a potentiostat (Autolab PGSTAT302N, Metrohm, Herisau, Swiss). After careful washing with deionized water, the Cu foam was immersed in an Ag displacement solution consisting of 0.05 M AgNO3 (99.9%, Alfa Aesar), 0.5 M (NH4)2SO4 (99.0%, Alfa Aesar), and 3.5 M NH4OH (28.0%, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, USA) for 10 min at room temperature.35 Ag displacement was conducted without and with the additives BTA (98.5%, Daejung), PVP (average mol. wt. 40 000, Sigma-Aldrich), and NA (95%, SigmaAldrich). All the electrolytes used to fabricate the Ag/Cu foams were purged by N2 gas (99.995%) flow for 30 min before the experiments. To image the morphologies of the Ag/Cu foams, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, SIGMA, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) was used. The crystal structure was analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD, New D8 Advance, Bruker-AXS, Billerica, Massachusetts, USA). The surface properties of the Ag/Cu foams were investigated using anodic scans in linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) in a 0.1 M KOH solution at a scan rate of 1 mV/s. Electrochemical CO2 conversion by the Ag/Cu foams was performed using an H-type cell (Pine Research Instrumentation, Durham, North Carolina, USA). The cell capacity was 25 mL for both the cathode and anode parts, which were separated by a proton-conducting membrane (Nafion, Wilmington, Delaware, USA NRE-212). The cathode part contained an Ag/Cu foam as a working electrode and an SCE as a reference electrode. The exposed area of the working electrode was fixed at 0.5 cm2. The anode part contained Pt gauze as a counter electrode. KHCO3 (99.5%, Daejung, 0.1 M) at a pH of 6.8 was used for both the catholyte and anolyte, which were purged by N2 gas for 30 min. Then, the catholyte was purged by CO2 gas (99.995%) at a rate of 300 sccm for at least 45 min before the activity measurement. To maintain CO2 saturation during the experiment, CO2 gas was continuously injected into the catholyte at a rate of 10 sccm, ensuring that the product gases entered the sampling loop for gas chromatography (GC, Agilent 7890A). The chronoamperometry method was adopted to analyze the catalytic activity of the Ag/Cu foams at various potentials for 30 min. The CO concentration generated at the cathode was measured by a flame ionization detector (FID) in the GC instrument. Then, the CO Faradaic efficiency was obtained by calculating the concentration of generated CO and the amount of electrochemically applied charge."

The surfaces of these supports were prepared by grinding with a 400 grit silicon carbide paper followed by ultrasonication to detach leftover abrasive particles from the surface. The Cu and C electrodes were further washed in dichloromethane (99.8 + %, Acros Organics), air dried, and dipcoated with P4VP by immersing the electrode in a 100 mg mL\u22bf1 polymer solution in dichloromethane for 60 s and slow (0.5 mm s\u22bf1) withdrawal. The thickness of the resulting P4VP films on Cu was 2 1 mm, as estimated by using ellipsometry (a-SE, J. A. Woollam Co.). The polymer-coated electrode was air-dried and soaked in 0.1 m KHCO3 for 2\u6bcf3 h to remove residual dichloromethane and to form CuII\u6bcfpolymer complexes. Afterwards, to protect the polymer coating from dissolution during electrolysis, the electrode was dipped for 1 s in a 0.1 % Nafion solution (water diluted 5 % Nafion solution from Aldrich) and dried overnight."

The lactic acid was added in the solution to form Cu(CH3CHOHCOO)2 preventing precipitation of Cu (OH)2 in the basic electrolyte solution. By complexing with the lactate ion, copper was stabilized, and the pH was raised to alkaline values by adding NaOH, at a controlled temperature of 60 \uff5eC. The formed complex was reduced to CuOH, which was further transformed to Cu2O upon dehydration. [8a,14] The Cu2O formation reactions are the following:"

CuCl2 and SnCl2 with a certain molar ratio (seeing Table S1 for details) were added into 50 mL of deionized water to obtain a homogeneous emulsion solution under continuous stirring for 1 h. Then concentrated ammonia hydroxide was added dropwise to the above solution until neutral. After vigorously stirring for another 2 h, the resultant precipitate was centrifugated, washed with deionized water and ethanol, and then dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 80 \uff5eC. Afterwards, the precipitate was annealed at 400 \uff5eC for 2 h in a muffle furnace. Finally, a series of SnO2/CuO NCs were obtained after naturally cooling to room temperature. As comparisons, the pure SnO2 and CuO were also synthesized by the similar method. In addition, the SnO2 CuO physical mixture was obtained by grinding the pure SnO2 and CuO in an agate mortar for 30 minutes."

The pH value was adjusted at 11 with 2.0 molL 1 NaOH in DEG prior to add the desired amount of carbon substrate (Vulcan XC72R), which is previously treated under N2 atmosphere at 400 \uff5eC for 4 h. The mixture was then maintained under vigorous stirring (1000 rpm) for 15 min in order to have a homogeneous suspension. Afterwards the mixture was rapidly heated in the microwave oven (CEM, Synthesis Technology Inside) with the power output of 1600 W irradiation at 185 \uff5eC under N2 gas flowing (1.0 bar) for 30 min.

Firstly, copper nanowires (Cu NWs) array was in-situ formed on the Cu foam (CF). After that, the surrounding Cu NWs was transformed into Cu3Sn alloy via a hydrothermal method in virtue of the neighbouring Sn source. Noted that the amorphous SnO2 shell was concomitantly developed on the Cu3Sn alloy surface because the Sn atom was prone to aggregating and oxidizing on the outer layer for low surface energy.[22] For the inner Cu3Sn core, the subsequent diffusion of Sn atoms from the inner to the outer layer as well as the residual Cu atoms both contributes to the formation of amorphous Cu doped SnO2 shell. Therefore, a unique coreshell-type Cu3Sn@Cu-SnO2 NWs hierarchical structure was obtained."

The characteristics of the prepared Bi/Cu catalyst electrodes were shown in figure 1. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (figure 1a) images showed that the Cu foam was coated by nano-coral-like structures. This morphological feature can be confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (figure 1b). High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) showed the lattice d-spacing with an average size of 0.329 nm, corresponding to the (012) face lattice distance of metallic Bi, indicating the coral-like microstructure is composed of Bi.[20] Moreover, the elemental distribution results by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscope (EDS) elemental analysis were presented in figure 1c\u6bcfe. Interestingly, the images revealed that both Bi and Cu were distributed uniformly on the coral-like structure, indicating that the co-deposition of Bi and Cu has taken place during the deposition process.[21] It is possibly related to the galvanic displacement reaction, the Cu [a] M.

The synthesis of the phenolic resin precursor (denoted resol) was slightly modified from the basic preparation described in the litterature26. The polymerization took place in basic conditions starting with phenol and formaldehyde. Typical phenolic resol preparation procedure is the following: 6.50 mmol phenol (Sigma Aldrich 99 %) was melted at 42 8C and then 0.65 mmol NaOH 20 wt.% (Sigma Aldrich ACS Reagent 97 %, pellets) was added slowly over 10 min under stirring. 13 mmol formaldehyde (Sigma Aldrich, 37 wt.% in H2O, contains 10\u6bcf15 % methanol as stabilizer) was added drop-wise, and the reaction mixture was stirred at 72 8C for 30 min. After cooling the mixture to room temperature, the pH value of the reaction mixture was adjusted to 8.0 using a 0.6 mol L 1 HCl (37 % AnalaR NORMAPUR ) aqueous solution. Water was then evaporated under vacuum below 50 8C and the final product was re-dissolved in 10 mL absolute ethanol. In parallel, 2.1 mmol Cu(NO3)2.3H2O was dissolved in 15 mL absolute ethanol, containing 1.0 g of Pluronic F-127. To obtain complete dissolution, the mixture was stirred at 1000 rpm for 30 min at 21 8C. Then, the phenolic resol solution was slowly dropped into the Pluronic-Copper nitrate solution under stirring (600 rpm) which was maintained for 30 min. Then, the mixture was disposed in four Petri dishes and dried under fume hood at 21 8C overnight. Thermo-polymerization was conducted at 100 8C for 24 h and carbonization was performed at 350 or 500 8C for 3 h with a heating rate of 5 8C min 1 under Argon atmosphere with a flow rate of 7 L min 1. The final products were denoted as Cu/FDU-15-T, where T represents the carbonization temperature as Cu/FDU-15-350 and Cu/FDU-15-500. In addition, FDU-15-T samples were prepared by using the same procedure but without adding the Cu salt precursor."

        "synthesis_paragraph": "Synthesis of the MOPMs: HKUST-1 was prepared by a previously described solvent-free synthetic route.[58] In a first step, stoichiometric amounts of benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid and copper(II) acetate monohydrate were ground together to ensure a homogeneous mixture and placed in the reaction vessel. The reagent mixture was oven-heated for approximately 50 h at a heating rate of 2 8C h 1 to a maximum temperature of 120 8C. Polycrystalline CuAdeAce material was prepared by the slow addition of acetic acid to an aqueous solution containing adenine and CuII salt in equimolar proportions.[59] Both MOFs were washed thoroughly with water to remove unreacted reagents and remaining byproducts. The general procedure to prepare the MOAs (CuDTA and CuZnDTA) proceeded as follows. The corresponding metal acetate (or metal salt mixture) was dissolved in a mixture of N,N\uff0a-dimethylacetamide (DMA) and DMF in a 60:40 volumetric ratio, aided by an ultrasonic tip (Vibra-Cell VCX130 20 kHz and 130 W, Sonics) at 80 % of its power for 2 min. Then, dithiooxamide (H2DTA) ligand, basified with triethylamine, was dissolved in the same solvent mixture and added into the metal-ion-containing solution with the system maintained in an ultrasound bath (ULTRASONS-H, Selecta) at a temperature of 288 K. Once the metal\u6bcforganic gel reached a certain consistency, it was allowed to age at room temperature for 1 d. Thereafter, the materials were washed first through immersion in pure DMF to remove the unreacted species and then by successive solvent exchanges in DMF/ethanol mixtures and pure ethanol to replace the solvent. In each exchange step, the contact between the solvent and gel was 24 h to ensure an efficient exchange. To prepare the aerogels, an E3100 critical-point dryer from Quorum Technologies equipped with gas-inlet, vent, and purge valves and a thermal bath was employed. Firstly, the gel was immersed in liquid CO2 at 293 K and 50 bar for 1 h. After this, the exchanged ethanol was removed through the purge valve. This process was repeated five times. Subsequently, the sample was dried under supercritical conditions at a temperature of 311 K and a pressure of 85\u6bcf95 bar. Finally, under constant temperature (311 K), the chamber was vented slowly to atmospheric pressure. Details on the characterization of the prepared MOPMs are provided in the Supporting Information (S2)."

NaBH4 (25 mg) was then dissolved in water (20 mL) and the solution was added slowly to the mixture and then kept stirring for 4 h, whereby Cu2+ was reduced into metallic Cu nanoparticles. The samples were collected by filtering and washed with deionized water (about 30 mL). Finally, the sample underwent heat treatment at 200 8C for 3 h in air to afford the CuO/NxC-600 8C, CuO/NxC-700 8C, or CuO/NxC800 8C catalysts. For comparison, we also prepared CuO supported on Vulcan XC-72 carbon black (CuO/XC-72) by a similar procedure. In comparison with the NxC, XC-72 carbon black has a low CO2 adsorption capacity.

The six catalysts, namely Cu, CuZnx (where x is the atomic ratio of Zn/(Cu+Zn) in the precursor solution, Cu-Zn) and ZnO, were prepared with various concentrations of different precursors (Table S1). In a typical synthesis, the Cu and Zn salts were dissolved in 35 mL of EG and 5 mL of H2O to form solution 1, and 914 mg of NaOH was dissolved in 17 mL of EG and 3 mL of H2O to form solution 2. Then, solution 2 was added into solution 1 drop by drop. After 10 min of vigorous agitation, the mixture was then transferred into a Teflon vessel (volume 100 mL). The Teflon vessel was put in a microwave oven (Milestone STARTSynth, Milestone Inc., Shelton, Connecticut) and connected to pressure and temperature probes. The mixture was irradiated for 11 min at 900 W (TMax. = 220 \uff5eC), and then was cooled to ambient temperature. The precipitate was separated by centrifuge and washed twice with H2O and once with ethanol. The powder sample was finally obtained by vacuum drying at 60 \uff5eC overnight."

Next, 1.0 g P-123 and extra 50 mL water were added to the above Cu(CH3COO)2\ufe5eH2O solution, which was stirred till all P-123 dissolved into the solution. After that, 8 mL of 0.1 m ascorbic acid aqueous solution was quickly injected to the mixed solution, and extra 42 mL water was added with stirring for 1 min. The 150 mL final solution was incubated for 3 h at room temperature. Then, the orange precipitates obtained were subsequently washed four times with 40 mL of water each time and once with 40 mL of acetone to completely remove the unreacted precursors.

First, PcCu\u6bcfFe\u6bcfZIF-8 was fabricated by mixing PcCu, iron nitrate, zinc nitrate, and 2-Me-imidazole. The mixture was stirred overnight to obtain a blue precipitate, as a result of the bonding of PcCu molecules to Fe, which is coordinated to the organic ligand as nodes, so it is ensured that the Cu and Fe species are dispersed in the framework homogeneously. Subsequently, the blue precipitates were annealed at 1000? \uff5eC under an argon atmosphere, and PcCu\u6bcfFe\u6bcfZIF-8 is carbonized and transformed into binary atomic Cu\u6bcfFe sites, dispersed on the nitrogen-doped carbon matrix without any further acid leaching treatment (denoted as Cu\u6bcfFe\u6bcfN6\u6bcfC; the details can be found in the Supporting Information)."

First, the solution was heated to 80?\uff5eC at a rate of 5 \uff5eC min?1 and maintained at 80?\uff5eC for 1 h. Then, the solution was gradually heated to 170 \uff5eC and 210 \uff5eC at a rate of 10 \uff5eC min?1, and each temperature section was maintained for 1 h to obtain Cu NPs. The obtained purple solution was cooled naturally to room temperature. For the preparation of Cu@Ag-2 NPs, the mixture of AgNO3 (0.2?mmol, 33.9?mg) and 10?mL of OAm was poured dropwise into the above purple solution of Cu NPs at the rate of 30?mL h?1. After vigorous stirring, the mixture solution was heated to 60?\uff5eC at 5 \uff5eC min?1 for 3 h under Ar atmosphere. The products were washed with hexane and acetone, and centrifuged at 3000?rpm for 10?min. The Cu@Ag-2 NPs were dried under vacuum at room temperature overnight for further characterization. The entire experiment process was kept under strict anaerobic conditions to prevent the possibility of NPs being oxidized."

        "synthesis_paragraph": "Cu2O/CuO /CuS catalyst was prepared on the commercially available copper mesh using scalable and simple two- step synthesis processes as shown in Scheme?1. During the first thermal oxidation, Cu2O/CuO layers were formed on the surface of the copper mesh and then copper sulfide nanoparticles were loaded on it by SILAR of Cu2O/CuO electrode in 0.01?M methanol solutions of copper nitrate and sodium sulfide. The thermal oxidation of copper mesh and the experimental set-up of the manually operated SILAR deposition system are illustrated in Scheme?1. That is, clean copper mesh (Scheme?1a) was firstly oxidized in air (at 450?\uff5eC for 4?h) to fabricate the electrode (Scheme?1b). Then Cu2O/ CuO was dipped in the cationic precursor solution (Cu(NO3)2) for 1?min, resulting in Cu2+ being adsorbed onto the surface of the Cu2O/CuO film (Scheme?1c). Consequently, this electrode was immersed in methanol solution for 10?s to remove excess adsorbed ions from the precursor (Scheme?1d). Thirdly, the sample was then immersed in the anionic precursor (Na2S) solution for 1?min, resulting in the reaction of sulfide ions (S2?) with the adsorbed Cu2+ on the surface of the Cu2O/CuO electrode (Scheme?1e). Lastly, the excess and/or unreacted species and the reaction byproduct from the diffusion layer were removed by rinsing the electrode in pure methanol solution (Scheme?1f). Through this, one cycle of CuS deposition on the surface of Cu2O/ CuO layer was completed. The amount deposited CuS can be increased and controlled by repeating the immersion cycles."

Briefly, 2.5?mL of 0.01?M Cu(NO3)2 3H2O, and 1.2?g of fructose were added into a 200?mL of double neck round bottom flask, followed by the addition of 2.5?mL of 1?M NaOH and 5?mL of 0.0788?M L-ascorbic acid. The resultant solution was diluted to 100?mL with ultrapure water. Thus prepared solution (pH 12.2) was mildly stirred for 1?h at room temperature. The resulting solution was centrifuged at a relative centrifugal force (RCF) of 20,000\u2105g for 20?min and re-suspended in ultrapure water. The same centrifugation procedure was repeated about three times to remove the unreacted species. The Cu2O nanoparticle solutions were stored at ??4?\uff5eC to avoid over-oxidation of the surface. However, partial oxidation of surface is inevitable due to the atmospheric oxygen. A similar procedure was followed by the addition of 1?mL of 10?mM NaCl, NaBr, or NaI aqueous solutions after the L-ascorbic acid. Thus synthesized copper oxide nanocubes are referred to as Cu2O/CuO, Cu2O/CuO_Cl, Cu2O/CuO_Br, and Cu2O/CuO_I respectively. Each 1?mL of Cu2O/CuO and Cu2O/CuO_X solutions were dried at 60?\uff5eC to determine the weight of Cu2O/CuO. The weight of nanocubes in 1?mL of Cu2O/CuO, Cu2O/CuO_Cl, Cu2O/CuO_Br, and Cu2O/ CuO_I was found to be 45 \u32a3 3, 42, \u32a3 4, 30 \u32a3 6 and 35 \u32a3 5?\u7c73g, respectively. 10?mL of 5 wt.% PVA aqueous solution was added to 10?mL (50?mg) of GO aqueous solution. Thus resulted PVA-GO mixture was sonicated for 30?min to achieve a homogeneous dispersion. 0.5?mL of hydrazine was added to the PVA-GO solution and heated at 95?\uff5eC for 3?h to form the PVA/rGO composite.

However, considering the partial surface oxidation of Cu2O, the nanocubes were designated as Cu2O/CuO. The growth rate, size, and morphology of Cu2O can be tuned by the presence of halides in the solution, where different halides possess different adsorption strengths on the crystal facets of Cu2O [29]. The addition of 1?mL of 10?mM sodium halides (NaCl, NaBr, or NaI) during the synthesis of nanocubes alters the ionic strength of the solution, which affects the growth of Cu adatoms and hence the size of nanocubes [30, 31]. Scheme?1a illustrates the step-wise processes involved in the synthesis of Cu2O/CuO nanocubes. Figure?1a\u6bcfd displays HR-TEM images of Cu2O/CuO, Cu2O/CuO_Cl, Cu2O/CuO_Br, and Cu2O/CuO_I nanocubes, respectively. The average size of Cu2O/CuO nanocubes was calculated to be 37 \u32a3 3?nm, while the presence of Cl? ions led to the formation of 10?nm smaller Cu2O/CuO_Cl nanocubes. While conducting the same synthesis procedure in presence of Br? or I?, larger particles were formed with average diameters of 62 \u32a3 4 and 207 \u32a3 3?nm, respectively. Figure S1(A) shows the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping of Cu, Cl?, Br? and I? elements. Figure S1(B) displays the EDS spectrum of the Cu2O/CuO_Cl, Cu2O/CuO_Br, and Cu2O/CuO_I nanocubes. The EDS mapping unambiguously displays the spatial distribution of Cl? ions with at.% of 0.39 on the surface of nanocubes, confirming the specificity of Cl? ion adsorption over the surface of Cu2O. Hence, the growth of Cu2O cubes was ceased by the preferable adsorption of Cl? ions over the surface of Cu2O, which resulted in smaller nanocubes. The adsorbed Cl? ions thermodynamically stabilizes the surface structures and increases the surface area of Cu2O/ CuO_Cl [29, 32]. Random and lower intensities of purple dots were observed in Figure S1(A)b\u222a and c\u222a, which indicates the presence Br? and I? ions without any specific adsorption on the surface of nanocubes. In addition, the at.% of Cl (0.39%) is higher than the Br? (0.20%) and I? (0.31%) elements. Ignaczak et?al. has shown that the decrease in adsorption energy while going from F? to I? on the Cu, Ag and Au metals via density functional theory calculations [33]. XPS is a sensitive technique to gain insight into the surface composition and electronic state of the species. The surface of Cu2O could undergo oxidation in ambient conditions and leave the surface of nanocubes with mixed oxidation states of Cu (such as Cu+ and Cu2+) [34]. Quantification of the relative amount of Cu(II) species on the Cu2O surface could give an insight into the catalytic activity of Cu2O nanocubes [35]. The ratios of Cu (I): Cu(II) was calculated from the Cu2p3/2 spectra using the methodology developed by Gerson and Jaseniak [36]. Figure?2 shows the Cu 2p core level profile XPS spectra of as-synthesized (a) Cu2O/CuO, (b) Cu2O/CuO_Cl, (c) Cu2O/CuO_Br and (d) Cu2O/CuO_I nanocubes. The deconvoluted XPS spectra of (a), (b), (c) and (d) displays the Cu2p3/2 level at 934.3, 934.2, 933.1 and 933.0?eV; Cu2p1/2 level at 954.3, 954.3, 954.0 and 952.8?eV respectively, which can be assigned to Cu+ present in Cu2O. Particularly, Cu2O/CuO_Cl, Cu2O/CuO_Br, and Cu2O/CuO_I nanocubes show peaks at 936.9, 935.0 and 934.9?eV respectively, these peaks can be assigned to Cu2+, which indicates the formation of CuO surface layer. The main peak present (935.0 and 934.9?eV) in Cu2O/ CuO_Br and Cu2O/CuO_I nanocubes indicates the significant oxide layer over the Cu2O surface. Hence, the availability of Cu2O active sites to the CO2RR has diminished significantly. Cu2O/CuO_Cl nanocubes consist of mainly Cu2O species (80%) with a minor surface CuO phase (20%). Peaks at 944.1, 944.5, 941.0, 942.0; 949.9?eV were"

PVA/rGO/ (Cu2O/CuO) solution was sonicated for 1?h to form an ink-like dispersion. The resulting ink (1?mL) was dropped on to (5?\u2105?2) cm2 area of a microscopic glass slide and dried overnight at room temperature to form PVA/rGO/ (Cu2O/CuO) film. Similarly, PVA/rGO/(Cu2O/CuO_Cl), PVA/rGO/(Cu2O/CuO_Br), and PVA/rGO/(Cu2O/CuO_I), thin films were prepared using ~ 1.31?\u7c73g of Cu2O/CuO_Cl, Cu2O/CuO_Br, and Cu2O/CuO_I solutions, respectively. In Fig.?3b, XRD patterns of all the films displayed a broad peak at 2\u725f value of 19.5\uff5e which corresponds to PVA [39]. The characteristic peaks of Cu2O/CuO or Cu2O/CuO_X did not appear because of their ultra-low (0.87\u6bcf3.06?\u7c73g/ cm2) loadings and their existence within the PVA/rGO sheets. The mechanical properties of PVA fibers facilitate the formation of a stable and flexible film. The free-standing PVA/rGO/(Cu2O/CuO_Cl) thin film is stable after twisting, and tape tests, showing its mechanical strength which is one of the desired properties of free-standing working electrodes (Figure S2). In the case of free-standing electrodes, no direct support of the current collector is used; hence the intrinsic electrical conductivity of thin films itself needs to be high enough to conduct the electrons. Electrical conductivity of PVA/rGO/(Cu2O/CuO), PVA/rGO/(Cu2O/CuO_Cl), PVA/rGO/(Cu2O/CuO_Br), and PVA/rGO/(Cu2O/CuO_I), films were measured to be 0.160, 0.182, 0.185 and 0.380 S/m via two probe-method, respectively. These conductivity values are four orders of magnitude lower than that of the reported rGO (2420 S/m) and 30 times lower than the rGO/PVA [39, 40]. The presence of non-conducting PVA on to the rGO sheets could decrease the conductivity of the free-standing thin films."

Cu2O/CuO nanocubes were synthesized in the presence of sodium halides (1?mL of 10?mM NaCl, NaBr and NaI) at room temperature. Cl? ion adsorption over the surface of Cu2O hindered the adsorption of adatoms to Cu2O crystal facets and formed 27 \u32a3 2?nm size particles, whereas Br? and I? ions did not show notable adsorption on Cu2O surface and yielded the particles with larger sizes, 62 \u32a3 4 and 207 \u32a3 3?nm, respectively. The high-resolution photoelectron spectrum revealed a small CuO surface phase present over the Cu2O nanocubes. The ratio of Cu2O: CuO for (a) Cu2O/CuO, (b) Cu2O/CuO_Cl, (c) Cu2O/CuO_Br and (d) Cu2O/CuO_I was calculated to be 87:13, 80:20, 34:66 and 35:65. PVA/rGO/(Cu2O/CuO_Cl) film exhibited superior CO2 reduction activity in terms of onset potential (??0.40?V vs. RHE) and current density (0.12?mA?cm?2 at ??0.80?V vs. RHE) than that of the PVA/rGO/(Cu2O/ CuO), PVA/rGO/(Cu2O/CuO_Br), and PVA/rGO/(Cu2O/ CuO_I) thin films. GC\u6bcfMS analysis revealed the formation of methanol as a single liquid product. Methanol yield of 19.5?\u7c73mol cm?2?h?1 at ??0.85?V vs. RHE is observed on the PVA/rGO/(Cu2O/CuO_Cl) thin film. The FE for methanol and H2 gas were found to be 63 and 20% at ??0.75?V vs RHE, respectively, which is the highest FE among the \u6bcf?0.75, ??0.80 and ??0.85?V vs. RHE. With the advantages of low-cost, flexibility, high mechanical strength, catalytic activity, and stability, the free-standing thin films prepared through direct evaporation assisted self-assembly method holds great potential for the use in electrocatalysis and chemical industries to generate pure methanol."

All the electrodes were characterized and used for electrocatalytic reduction of CO2. The pure Cu2O film electrode obtained by immersing and reacting in saturated CuSO4 solution for 2?h had a more uniform particle distribution, and its CH3OH yield was the highest in the pure Cu2O film electrodes, indicating that Cu(I) species may have a good selectivity to CH3OH in CO2 reduction, and significantly improved the electrode activity. In contrast, the Cu(II) sites were more prone to hydrogen evolution, which inhibited the reduction of CO2. The ZnO/Cu2O film electrode prepared under the condition of a Zn2+ concentration of 0.05?M and with the deposition time of 30?min had a very high CH3OH formation rate of 52.609?\u7c73mol/ (cm2 h), and the Faradaic efficiency reached 45%, both of which were significantly higher than other electrodes. The experimental results indicated that the appropriate Zn2+ concentration and deposition time produced ZnO with uniform shape, distribution, and large specific surface area, thereby enhancing the CO2 adsorption capacity of electrodes. Moreover, the addition of ZnO helped the intermediate products of CO2 reduction to be better fixed on Cu2O. The fundamental reaction mechanisms of CO2 reduction to form CH3OH on the surface of pure Cu2O and ZnO/Cu2O films were also elucidated, which included the transfer of CO2, reduction of CO2 to intermediate product, and proton transfer to H3CO to form CH3OH. The results of this paper provided a relatively reasonable explanation for the electrocatalytic reduction performance of pure Cu2O and ZnO/Cu2O films, and provided some new schemes for the preparation of electrodes for electrocatalytic reduction of CO2."

The typical procedure is as follows: 40 mg PVP, 25 mg CTAB, and 50 mL EG were placed into a three-necked flask under constant magnetic stirring (300 r?min\u6bcf1) and heated in an oil bath. When the temperature reached 140\uff5eC, 9 mL of 0.11 mol?L\u6bcf1 Cu(CH3COO)2 solution was injected. The mixture was heated to 170\uff5eC and maintained for 10 min under continuous stirring. The color of the mixture solution changed from deep blue to dark green, indicating the formation of Cu2O. After the solution cooled to room temperature, Cu2O was separated by centrifugation with acetone, pure water, and ethanol at 8000 r?min\u6bcf1 for 10 min in sequence. The obtained precipitates were dried at 60\uff5eC for 24 h in a vacuum oven. For the synthesis of Ag/Cu2O, the Cu2O spheres were not separated from the solution. In one pot, the required amount of AgNO3 solution was added to the Cu2Ocontaining mother solution at 170\uff5eC. The mixture was stirred for another 10 min, during which the color of the solution changed from dark green to deep gray. Finally, the suspension was centrifuged and the obtained solid was dried under the same conditions as mentioned above. The Ag content of the Ag/Cu2O composites was tuned by varying the concentration of the AgNO3 solution. The samples are denoted as Agx/Cu2O, where x represents the atomic ratio of Ag to Cu added to the reaction mixture. The obtained products are accordingly denoted as Ag0.125/ Cu2O, Ag0.25/Cu2O, Ag0.5/Cu2O, and Ag1/Cu2O. Galvanic replacement was also employed to synthesize Au/Cu2O using the as-prepared Cu2O nanospheres as a template. In the typical procedure: 7.2 mg of Cu2O nanospheres was added to 26 mL deionized water at room temperature. Thereafter, 3 mL PVP aqueous solution (1.0 wt-%) was added to the above solution under stirring, followed by 0.5 mL of 0.06 mol?L\u6bcf1 aqueous chloroauric acid solution. After 3 h of reaction, the suspension was centrifuged. The obtained solid was washed with pure water and ethanol, and dried at 60\uff5eC for 24 h in a vacuum oven."

First, Cu2O nanospheres, with a uniform particle size of ~180 nm, were prepared. Thereafter, Ag/Cu2O composites were fabricated by using Cu2O as a sacrificial template. By varying the Ag/ Cu atomic ratio, a Ag0.125/Cu2O composite possessing a hierarchical flower-like nanostructure with intersecting Ag nanoflakes encompassing an inner Cu2O sphere were prepared. The catalytic performance in the ERC was evaluated in terms of the FE of each product and current density. In comparison with the Cu2O nanospheres, the Ag/ Cu2O samples all present a higher FECO and somewhat suppressed H2 evolution due to the combination of the catalytic ability of Ag combined with Cu2O. Notably, Ag0.125/Cu2O exhibited the highest CO evolution rate as a result of the hierarchical structure, which provides a larger electroactive surface area. The obtained Au0.6/Cu2O composite with the same flower-like structure presented superior catalytic performance with a 10% higher FECO. Importantly, the results reveal that Ag0.125/Cu2O and Au0.6/Cu2O exhibit remarkably improved stability over that of Cu2O. This study presents a facile way to synthesize hierarchical noble metal-metal oxide composites for designing highly efficient and stable electrocatalysts for the electrochemical reduction of CO2."

        "synthesis_paragraph": "A Cu electrode modified with ultra-small Cu nanoparticles (~ 4 nm diameter) embedded in N-doped carbon arrays was fabricated using CuTCNQ arrays as a sacrificial template. The Cu@NC modified electrode enables highly controlled CO2 reduction to CO and formate in DMF (0.1 M Bu4NPF6) containing 0.5 vol% H2O and maintains stable catalytic activity for over 6 h under electrolytic conditions. The water content in the DMF electrolyte medium acts as the sole proton source for CO2 reduction, with a higher water content leading to the formation of more formate and hydrogen, and less CO. Under optimized conditions at \u6bcf2.4 V vs. Fc/Fc+ with 0.5 vol% water, a product distribution of 64% formate, 20% CO, and 13% H2 was obtained, which was rationalized by the competition of the CO and formate formation pathways. The CO-forming pathway lacks efficiency at low applied potential because the formation of *C2O4?\u6bcf is not thermodynamically favorable. However, at more negative potentials, the polarizable CO2\ufe5e\u6bcf radical anion electrostatically interacts with the negative charge on the electrode surface. Control experiments and post-electrolysis analysis showed that the significantly higher catalytic current density and improved product selectivity of the Cu@NC array electrode could be attributed to its 3D micro structure and Cu nanoparticles embedded in the NC. This study demonstrates the potential for improving electrocatalytic CO2 reduction efficiency through structural design of the catalyst. Finally, it is worth noting that this bottom-up synthetic method is applicable to other metal substrates, such as Ag, Ni and Zn [46, 47], that can spontaneously react with TCNQ to form nanostructured metal-TCNQ."

After annealing at 350 \uff5eC, the Cu(OH)2 turned to CuO, as confirmed by the change of XRD patterns before and after annealling (Fig. S1 in the Electronic Supplementary Material (ESM)). The subsequent electrochemical reduction led to the formation of metallic Cu array, as evidenced by both XPS and XRD characterizations (Figs. S1 and S2 in the ESM). The SEM image confirmed the morphology of NW array after electrochemical reduction (Fig. 2(a)). The width of the nanowire was ~ 100 nm as revealed by TEM characterization of a single Cu wire peeled off from the array electrode (Fig. 2(b)). HRTEM showed obvious grain boundaries on the surface of Cu nanowire, suggesting polycrystalline nature of Cu NW (Fig. 2(c)) and the selected area electron diffraction results further confirmed its polycrystalline feature (Fig. S3 in the ESM). The electrode assembled by arrayed Cu NWs showed a superaerophobic surface, as evidenced by a contact angle of 154.4\uff5e for CO2 gas bubbles on such a Cu array surface (Fig. 2(d)). Meanwhile, the contact angle for the 0.1 M KHCO3 aqueous solution (i.e. CO2RR electrolyte) was 32.9\uff5e, revealing a hydrophilic state. This aerophobic surface nature facilitated the leaving of gas products thus giving a stable current density (Fig. 2(e)). However, when immersing the Cu NW array electrode in a 5% PTFE solution, a thin layer of PTFE was uniformly coated on the surface of Cu NWs (Fig. 2(b) and Fig. S4 in the ESM), which changed the affinity towards gaseous CO2 and electrolyte significantly (Fig. 2(f)). Meanwhile, both the Cu NW array structure and the surface electronic structure were maintained (Figs. S5 and S6 in the ESM). The contact angles for CO2 gas bubbles and electrolytes were measured to be 48.4\uff5e and 136.6\uff5e, respectively, suggesting the surface turned from aerophobic/hydrohpilic to aerophilic/hydrophobic state. Such a gas affinitive surface would lead to a stronger bubble adhesion, and hold the gaseous products for a longer time during electrochemical CO2RR process. Thus, the bubbles were kept on the electrode surface till the size got bigger than 1 mm or more. When the size of product bubbles got large enough to detach, the working surface area recovered at the sudden moment of bubble releasing. Repeated accumulation and release caused fluctuations of current with sharp jump and steady decay (Fig. 2(g))."

After stirring at room temperature for 30min, a small amount of triethanolamine was added to adjust the pH to 4.3. With further stirring of the solution for 12 h, a yellowish transparent solution was obtained. Glass and ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned successively via ultra-sonication in acetone, isopropanol, Helmanex? solution, and deionized water. CIS films were obtained on glass and ITO-coated glass substrates by spin coating at 3000 rpm for 15 s. The thickness of the films was varied using sequential (layer by layer) spin coating of the solution. The samples were dried on a hot plate under open air condition for 2 min, at 300 \uff5eC. Finally, the films were annealed in a furnace at 420 and 460 \uff5eC for 30 min in a nitrogen environment."

In Fig. 1, the Cu/Co atomic ratio is shown in the top-left corner of the SEM images and the preparation ratio (Cu/Co) is shown in brackets. The Cu/Co atomic ratio differs from the preparation ratio because Co is more electronegative than Cu. Moreover, the SEM images of the electrodes show that the morphologies changed with increasing Co content. The electrodeposited Cu electrode (Cu100) shows large grain aggregates, whereas the electrodeposited Co electrode (Co100) shows needle-like crystals (data not shown). The grain aggregates of the Cu-Co electrodes tend to become smaller and finer with increasing Co content. corresponding to Cu despite the presence of Co, as detected by EDS. These results suggested that Co is solid soluted in the Cu crystalline framework, i.e., formed a substitutional solid solution. Figure 3 shows the XPS spectra of the electrodes. The binding energies of Cu 2p in all the electrodes are similar and show no change in spite of Co inclusion. The binding energy of Co 2p was observed with increasing Co content."

The product was subsequently aged for 6 h under vigorous stirring followed by centrifugation and washing with deionized water several times. The precipitate was dried at 80 \uff5eC overnight and calcined at 330 \uff5eC in air for 1 h. The obtained samples were labeled as 7CuO/3ZnO/C in which the corresponding molar ratio of Cu : Zn was 7 : 3. The control sample was prepared without adding Zn(NO3)2, and denoted as CuO/C. Additionally, two more samples with different molar ratios of Cu : Zn (8 : 2 and 9 : 1) were prepared and labeled as 8CuO/2ZnO/C and 9CuO/ 1ZnO/C, respectively."

Firstly, it carried out potentiostatically in 10 mM SnCl2 and 0.1 M KCl mixture aqueous solution at -0.6 V vs. Ag/ AgCl for 7 min at room temperature and was rinsed with DI water and dried by N2, thus Sn nanoparticle formed on substrate. Then the containing Sn nanoparticles substrate was carried out potentiostatically in 10 mM CuCl2 and 0.1 M KCl mixture aqueous solution through under-potential deposition, thus Cu formed embedded in Sn nanoparticles.

Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) images (Figure 1c) reveal that C, O, and Cu elements are homogeneously distributed over the entire G-CuxO-2h sample, suggesting a uniform CuxO decoration on graphene oxides. The mass content of Cu in the samples was determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES), as shown in Table S1. We noted that there is no obvious difference of Cu content for all samples, indicating Cu element can be well maintained during reduction in H2. The high-resolution TEM image (Figure 1d) shows the lattice fringe spacings of 2.13 ? and 2.30 ?, corresponding to the (200) facet direction of Cu2O and the (111) facet direction of CuO, respectively.[6, 21] It suggests that the as-prepared G-CuxO-2h mainly consisted of Cu2O and CuO, which might be caused by the reduction treatment in H2 atmosphere. To further compare the effect of reduction time on the morphology, Figure S1 shows the SEM images of obtained GCuxO-T samples. As seen, all the samples exhibited similar structure, indicating that the samples can inherit the morphology and structure of GO template even after the reduction treatment in H2. We noted that G-CuxO-2.5h sample exhibited some aggregated nanoparticles at the surface, which might be caused by formation of Cu(0) after excessive reduction of Cu(I)."

A spectral graphite carbon wire was used as the counter electrode and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) was applied as the reference electrode. Considering Sn2+/Sn (LSV Sn) couple has a more negative reduction potential than Cu2+/Cu (LSV Cu) couple (Fig. S1), the chosen constant potential to successfully co-electroplate Cu/Sn should make sure that Cu2+ and Sn2+ could be simultaneously evolved from electroplate liquid (LSV CuSn). Key to the co-electroplating Cu/Sn was applied at -0.75 V vs SCE due to the intersection of three LSVs, while the depositing time was prolonged to 6h below 20oC in order that the N-CC was fully wrapped by Cu/Sn. The plating solution contains different molar ratio of SnCl2 2H2O and CuCl2 2H2O in total 0.02 M, 0.1 M Na3C6H5O7 2H2O and 0.1 M CH4N2O. The obtained electrodes are denoted as Cu-N-CC, Cu(1)Sn(1)-N-CC, Cu(1)Sn(4)-N-CC, Cu(1)Sn(9)-N-CC, Sn-N-CC according to the molar ratio of Cu2+ and Sn2+ in plating solution, respectively."

In brief, a monolayer of ordered and close-packed PMMA nanosphere array was prepared on a clean glass slide driven by surface tension at the interface of water/glass/air (Scheme 1a).[51, 52] The PMMA array was then transferred and lifted off on the top of an aqueous solution containing polymer micelles (15 mg/mL). The array can float at the water-air interface due to the hydrophobic nature of PMMA nanospheres (Scheme 1b and c). The monolayer of the PMMA nanospheres was then picked up using a carbon paper electrode."

Examination of the self-cleaning property of the modified PET fabrics with CTA and CD or gum and after treated with nano titania showed maximum dye removal of using CD was attained when nano titania cured with the modified PET fabrics for 25 min, while curing for 15 min is quite enough to reach the maximum % of dye release in case of gum. The PET fabrics treated with CTA-gym and after treated with nano titania shows higher ability to remove MB dye (95.5%) in comparison with those of CD-CTA (91.7%). The xanthan gum is able to maintain the bonded nano titania without noticeable decrease in the self cleaning property of the PET fabrics, even after 10 washing cycles."

RT and MT showed two clearly distinguishable reduction peak without altering the reduction peak potential at PTH/GCE with a significant increase of reduction Jpeak , while the reduction of these two drugs at anodized GCE did not showed neither a well- separated peak nor an increased Jpeak.

        "synthesis_paragraph": "Overall, the growth mechanism has been difficult to elucidate due to the varied nature of each synthetic method. In short, there are three approaches in which CNTs are grown. The first of which takes large bulk carbons and atomizes them in a vacuum chamber. The atoms are then recombined upon cooling to form CNTs downstream of the atomization source. This breakdown of large carbons will be frequently addressed as the 鈥渢op-down鈥?approach. Common methods for this approach are an arc-discharge between graphite electrodes and a laser ablation of graphite rods. These techniques can produce large quantities of either SWNTs or MWCNTs (depending on specific parameters) but with a large distribution of sizes and a low purity. The second of these approaches takes small organic precursors and builds them up into the desired product, also known as the 鈥渂ottom-up approach鈥? This approach usually follows a scheme in which a mixture of hydrocarbon gas and an inert carrier gas is first pumped into a chamber. From here, popular methods for this kind of synthesis deviate greatly such as thermal chemical vapor deposition (CVD) in which a tube furnace is used to initiate CNT growth; or microwave-assisted CVD in which microwave energy is used to generate a highly-reactive plasma. Many variations on the bottom-up approach can be employed such as using larger liquid-phase hydrocarbons through a bubbler system instead of gases, using a resistive material as the heat source to initiate reaction also known as the hot filament CVD method, or ultra-high vacuum (P < 10-6 Pa) to encourage rapid cooling from the heat source to the substrate for defect-free material growth. Overall, the bottom-up approach gives low to average yields, medium to high purity, and a narrower distribution of sizes compared to the top-down approach."

The acid-acetylene black mixture changed from a powdery black solution to a dark brown with small amounts of particulates over the four hour period. After cooling to room temperature, the solution was placed in an ice bath and slowly neutralized with KOH (solid pellet) until a large precipitation of salt was formed. The GQD-unreacted acetylene black and salt mixture was vacuum filtered through 2.5 碌m filter paper to remove most of the salt and large carbon particles. The neutralization and filtration processes were repeated until the stock GQD solution was pH = 6. Then, 25 mL of stock GQD solution was filtered through a 200 nm pore syringe filter to remove any remaining carbon microparticles. After the final filtration, a MWCO = 100-500 Da dialysis bag was filled with the syringe-filtered solution and dialyzed against ultrapure water for one week to remove dissolved salts.

Overall, five samples were submitted with two distinct sample sets. In the first sample set, CQDs were made using a top-down approach by chemically oxidizing carbon nano-onions (CNOs) with nitric and sulfuric acid. In this case, sulfuric acid acts as an intercalating agent which assists in 鈥減eeling off鈥?layers of the carbon nano-onion. At the same time, nitric acid can strongly oxidize either the inherent defects of the CNO or the exposed edges of the carbon nano-onion layer. These two processes result in the formation of graphene quantum dots (GQDs). Generally, GQDs produced in this way are large, aromatic sp2-carbon planes about 5 to 10 nm in diameter with edges terminated with hydroxyl, carbonyl, and carboxyl functional groups. The number and proportion of these functional groups vary from particle to particle but can be quantitatively averaged using X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy. Previous results with Atomic Force Microscopy suggest that the ox-GQD are not monodisperse but instead tend to aggregate into stacks of three to five."

The reaction was terminated when the reflux solution became clear and brownish in color. Afterwards, this solution was first centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 90 minutes to allow the precipitation of unreacted carbon nano-onions. Then, the supernatant was neutralized with K2CO3 and dialyzed for 6 days with a dialysis bag (1 kDa MWCO) to remove excess ions from the neutralization. After dialysis, the resulting solution contains the purified ox-GQD in water. N-GQDs were prepared by reacting ox-GQDs with NH4OH in a hydrothermal reactor, as similar to the report by Tetsuka et al7 First, ox-GQDs were mixed with 5.0 M NH4OH (1:2 v/v). The mixture was then placed into a 200 mL stainless steel autoclave reactor for 5 hours. The hydrothermal temperature of the reaction was varied from 90鈥?90 掳C. NGQD-X prepared at a specific temperature such as 150 掳C will now be referred as NGQD-150. A simplified scheme of this procedure is shown below in Scheme 3.1."

About 1 minute after t0, a uniformly pale yellow liquid is observed. The pyrolytic reaction was quenched by adding 100 mL of 0.1 M KOH solution. The obtained CNDs were labeled as 鈥? min CNDs鈥? These CNDs seem to be a loose polymer of carbonized citric acid with a mixture of sp2- and sp3-hybridized carbon. The proposed structure of 1 min CNDs can be seen in Scheme 1. When the reaction continues to pyrolyze without KOH quenching, the color of the liquid changes from pale yellow to bright yellow, to orange, and finally to orange-red. The observed color change is consistent with the previous work by Dong et al and is indicative of newly formed C-C sp2-hybridized carbon.1 At 10 minutes after t0, the liquid becomes a deep red indicating more complete carbonization of CNDs. Any longer carbonization than 15 minutes using hotplate pyrolysis dries the product out and can burn the product. This can still create quantum dots, but their solubility in water is reduced and their photoluminescence was found to be negligible. The carbonization of CNDs is quenched by 100 mL of 0.1 M KOH solution and the resultant CNDs are labeled as 鈥?0 min CNDs鈥? In order to remove the excess ions K+ and OH-, dialysis was performed on 1 min and 10 min CNDs using 1 kDa MWCO dialysis membranes for about 3 days. Both 1 min CNDs and 10 min CNDs were treated with aqueous ammonia in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave reactor. The nitrogendoped CNDs are referred to as 鈥? min NCNDs鈥?and 鈥?0 min NCNDs鈥? The hydrothermal treatment was conducted for 5 hours at 180 掳C. The NCNDs were subjected to the same dialysis procedure to remove excess ammonia. All of the hydrothermally treated CNDs have a control solution of 1 min CNDs and 10 min CNDs that were subjected to the same hydrothermal conditions but in the absence of aqueous ammonia. These are referred to as 鈥? min HT-CNDs鈥?and 鈥?0 min HT-CNDs鈥? respectively."

This approach was chosen in order to investigate whether the nanoparticle size of the CuO@C sample could be maintained in the CuS@C and Cu2S@C samples. Figure 1 shows the X-ray diffractograms of CuO@C, CuS@C, Cu2S@C and of bare carbon as a reference. For all four samples, diffraction lines are observed at 30.6\uff5e and 64.1\uff5e, which can be ascribed to the crystalline graphite support, which clearly was not damaged by the treatments. The CuO@C sample shows additional diffraction lines at 41.5\uff5e, 45.3\uff5e and 57.0\uff5e, which can be indexed with the monoclinic structure of CuO (PDF-01-070-6831 (ICDD, 2019) [30]). Upon sulfidation using thioacetamide, the diffraction pattern shows clear diffraction lines at 34.1\uff5e, 37.1\uff5e, 38.3\uff5e and 56.3\uff5e, which is consistent with the hexagonal CuS covellite structure (PDF-00-006-0464 (ICDD, 2019) [30]). The formation of metal sulfides using TAA has been described before and two different mechanisms are proposed.[31\u6bcf33] CuS can be formed in a direct reaction, via the formation and subsequent decomposition of Cu-TAA complexes, or via a hydrolysis reaction, where the hydrolysis of TAA yields H2S and H2S subsequently reacts with Cu2+ (either dissolved or in CuO nanoparticles) to form CuS."

All electrochemical measurements were conducted with a CHI-760D electrochemical workstation using a single-compartment electrochemical cell at room temperature. Reference electrode was a Ag/AgCl electrode and counter electrode was a Pt wire. For working electrode, Pt/C ink was cast on a glassy carbon electrode (diameter = 3 mm) by two methods. The first was a two-step method. The dispersion of Pt/C (5 mg/mL in DI water) was ultrasonicated for 1 h to obtain homogeneous catalyst ink. Then, 6 碌L ink was dropped on the surface of glassy carbon. After being air dried, 5 碌L 0.5 wt% Nafion was added to cover the surface of electrodes. The second is a one-step method. The mixture of Pt/C (5 mg/mL) and Nafion (volume ratio of Nafion to water is 1:9) was prepared and thoroughly sonicated. Then, the ink (6 碌L) was dropped on the surface of glassy carbon. After being air dried, the electrode was immediately tested without further Nafion addition. An electrolyte solution was either N2 or O2 purged before and during electrochemical measuring. Electrochemically surface area (ECSA) was calculated by cyclic voltammetric measurements. The durability test was conducted at -0.4 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) with 1600 rpm rotation in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH for 20000s. Finally, Pt/C was treated by cycling a potential of -0.2 to 1.0 V in N2-saturated 0.1 M HClO4 at a scan rate of 0.1 V/s. volammetric (LSV) curves of Pt/C in 0.1 M KOH before and after ADT. The potential is relative to Ag/AgCl reference. An ADT is executed by holding the potential at -0.4 V for 20000 sec. The CVs include the features of hydrogen adsorption (Hads) and desorption (Hupd) peaks in the potential range from -0.9 to -0.5 V. The formation of Pt oxide and its reduction are found in the potential range from -0.3 to -0.1 V.121-122 The ECSA is estimated by counting the charge of hydrogen desorption (Hupd) in the CV curve (shown in Figure 4.1a), based on the following equation: where mPt is a platinum loading (mg) on the electrode, QH is the charge for hydrogen desorption ( C), and Qref is 0.21 mg/cm2, which represents charge for the adsorption of H2 monolayer on the surface of Pt123. A larger ECSA suggests more catalytic sites for electrochemical reaction.14 A previous report suggests the loss of ECSA is the main reason for fuel cell performance degradation.14 Compared to the initial ECSA of Pt/C (59.1 卤 4.5 m2/g), the catalyst loses 10.3% ECSA after 20000 s chronoamperometric i-t test (Figure 4.1a). A half-wave potential is shifted to the negative direction by ~40 mV, which is consistent with a previous report.124 An onset potential in the LSV is also negatively shifted by ~10 mV (Figure 4.1b). Despite the reduction of ECSA and the shift of the onset potential, Pt/C maintains 95.2卤1.0 % of current intensity after ADT. This result is significantly better than the values (45-70 %) of Pt/ C reported in previous literature (Table 4.1)."

For the working electrode, n-CNOs were cast on planar glassy carbon current collector (diameter = 4 mm). 0.1 M KHCO3 was dissolved in water as an electrolyte. The catalytic performance of n-CNOs was evaluated by CV. The n-CNO working electrode was prepared as follows. n-CNO (2 mg/mL) dispersion was obtained by mixing 6 mg n-CNOs with 3 ml de-ionized water with 50 碌L of 5 wt% Nafion. A catalyst ink was obtained by ultrasonicating n-CNO in water for 1 h. Afterwards, 40 碌L of the ink was dropped on glassy carbon electrode. Then, the electrode was dried before electrochemical characterizations. The electrolyte was purged with CO2 for 30 minutes before each measurement. The flow rate of CO2 gas was maintained at 57 sccm to ensure that the electrolyte was saturated with CO2. Cyclic voltammograms were also recorded with N2-saturated electrolyte for comparison."

A 0.1 M copper sulfate pentahydrate with 1 wt% fructose and 0.2 M KOH were used to produce the nanoparticles. The resulting yellow coloured slurry was cleaned and the solids were freezedried. The powder XRD pattern confirmed the presence of pure phase Cu2O with a cubic structure, similar to the standard reference pattern for Cu2O (JCPDS 01-071-3645) (Figure 2 a)). The pattern showed the existence of only the Cu2O phase with no secondary phases from CuO or Cu metal, confirming that the short residence time within the first CJM was sufficient to form pure-phase Cu2O. The sharp peaks indicated the particles were crystalline in nature and the application of the Scherrer equation resulted in a crystallite size of 35 nm. Surface analysis of the Cu2O sample showed the existence of Cu2O (peak 2p3/2 at 932.3 eV) but also the presence of CuO phase, as confirmed from the satellite peaks and the presence of the 2p3/2 peak at 934.8 eV corresponding to CuO (Figure 2 b)). The existence of CuO in the surface analysis suggests the presence of an amorphous CuO layer on the surface of the Cu2O nanoparticles, which was likely not seen in the XRD due to its amorphous nature. This is expected as the surface undergoes oxidation from Cu2O to form amorphous CuO due to the unstable Cu + oxidation state. As-synthesised nano-powders were also characterised by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Figure 2 c)) where round crystalline nanoparticles were observed. Bersani et al. synthesized CuO nanoparticles using CHFS where the nanoparticles were crystalline with diameter of 11 \u32a3 4 nm from TEM [14]. The electrochemical behaviour of the as-prepared Cu2O nanoparticles was subsequently examined to evaluate the performance of Cu2O nanoparticles for CO2 conversion."

Then, the solution was transferred to an autoclave (25mL). A piece of Cu foil (1 2.5 cm2) was immersed into the reaction solution and the autoclave was sealed tightly and maintained at 100 C for 12 h. After cooling to room temperature naturally, the precursor was rinsed with DI for at least 3 times and then dried in the air. Co3O4 nanowire arrays were synthesized by annealing of the precursor in air at 350 C for 4 hwith a heating rate of 1 C min 1, and naturally cooled to room temperature."

Then, 10.0 mL NaOH aqueous solution (2.0 mol L-1) was added dropwise into the above transparent light green solution. During this process, the solution color changes from blue-green to dark brown. The reaction mixture was stirred for 0.5 h, keeping the temperature at 55 掳C. Afterwards, 10 ml of an aqueous ascorbic acid solution (0.6 mol L-1) was added dropwise and the mixture was aged for 3 h under constant stirring and strict temperature control (55 掳C). This last stage gradually produces a red suspension. The resulting precipitate was collected by centrifugation and washed consecutively with 10 ml of deionized water and absolute ethanol (5 times).

Similarly, RM-2 was prepared by taking 25 ml of 0.1 M solution of TX-100 in cyclohexane and adding 300 ml of n-hexanol and 225 ml of a 5% (w/v) aq. solution of NaBH4. Both the microemulsions were left stirring for 30 min. so as to obtain optically clear homogeneous dispersions. RM-2 was then added to RM-1 drop-wise with continuous stirring. The resulting solution was left for stirring for another 3 h to allow the growth of Cu nanoparticles to its completion which is termed as \u203bOstwald ripening\u00a7. A nitrogen atmosphere was maintained throughout the process to ensure the complete removal of oxygen thereby preventing the oxidation of the metal. Instantaneous development of brown colour indicated the formation of the copper nanoparticles."

Then, the reactor is connected to the experimental setup, purged with CO2 (at cylinder pressure ~60 bar) and heated up. Once the reactor reaches the set-point temperature (200 oC) the pressure of CO2 is increased by pumping up to 100 bar and maintained at these conditions (in batch mode) for 60 minutes to achieve the dissolution of the metal precursor. Then, hydrogen is introduced inside the reactor and pressure is increased up to 250 bar for 30 minutes to reduce the metal precursor to its metallic form.

The catalysts obtained from the supercritical fluid deposition have been used to prepare a catalytic ink. This ink is then sprayed on two pieces of carbon paper (Toray? Teflon TM treated) using an airbrush to form the catalytic layer of the GDE. A metal load of 0.4 mg of metal cm-2 has been deposited for each electrode. Both pieces of carbon paper are then assembled to both sides of a Nafion? 117 membrane (in contact with the catalytic layer) by hot pressing. This assembly is set in the PEM type cell. To carry out the electroreduction experiments, a KHCO3 solution is circulated through the anodic part of the electrochemical cell while a continuous CO2 flowrate is passed on the cathodic flow channel of the cell. The experiments are made under galvanostatic operation mode for two hours. Gas products obtained are circulated to the GC while liquids are collected in a cold trap for further analysis by SPME in the GC. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Characterization of Cu/CNT catalysts synthesized Transmission electronic microscopy, X-ray diffraction and ICP have been used to characterize the Cu/CNT catalyst developed in this work. Figure 1 shows two of the micrographs taken using TEM as well as the nanoparticle size distribution obtained from the micrographs. As it can be appreciated in figure 1a, copper nanoparticles (black dots in the image) seem to be homogenously dispersed onto the carbon nanotubes surface. In addition, Figure 1b shows that the size of the nanoparticles formed can be small enough to be deposited inside the carbon nanotubes (inner diameter of 4.5 nm \u32a3 0.5 nm according to the supplier). The size distribution of the copper nanoparticles confirms these observations. As it can be seen in figure 1c most of the particles have a mean diameter between 1.5 and 5 nm showing a normal distribution with most of the particles with diameters around 2 and 3 nm. Furthermore, around 14 % of the nanoparticles have a mean diameter above 6 nm, in some cases due to the agglomeration of nanoparticles."

Then, the as-prepared Cu(OH)2 precipitates were washed with water for three times and then transferred to an electronic oven maintained at 80 \uff5eC for 6 h to make it dry. Finally, black CuO powder was obtained by annealing the powder above in air at 500 \uff5eC for 2 h with a heating rate of 2 \uff5eC/min. 15.0 mL 0.5 M CuSO4 and 0.5 M KI aqueous solutions were prepared, respectively. Then the KI solution was dropped into the CuSO4 solution with a speed of one drop per second. After finishing dropping, the mixed solution was stirred for an extra 5 minutes. The precipitate was washed with ethanol and ultrapure water for three times and then dried at 50 \uff5eC for 3 h. Finally, white CuI powder was obtained. 2.4.

Cu foam with a thickness of 80 \u7c73m (MTI Corp USA) was successively washed with acetone (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.9 %), ultrapure water (18.2 M\u6b21 cm -1 at 25 \uff5eC, Millipore Milli-Q system), and 3.0 M HCl (Fluka, 37 %) for 30 min under ultrasonic condition to remove organic contaminants and possible oxide layers on the surface. After then, it was rinsed with ultrapure water and dried at 80 \uff5eC in a vacuum oven, before using it as the working electrode. A three-electrode setup was used with a carbon rod as counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl/Sat. KCl as reference electrode, connected to an IM6ex electrochemical workstation (Zahner). The electrolyte was 1.0 M KOH (Merck) solution, which was deaerated by bubbling N2 for at least 30 min before experiments. The Cu foam was electrochemically anodized at room temperature and constant current density of 10 mA cm -2 for 10 min to form Cu(OH)2 NWs. After anodization, samples were rinsed with ultrapure water and annealed at 150 \uff5eC for 1.5 h under static air, to dehydration of Cu(OH)2 to CuO. Atomic layer deposition of TiO2 was conducted on a Beneq thin-film system (TFS 200, Beneq Corporation), according to a previous work [23]. TiO2 was deposited using titanium isopropoxide (C12H28O4Ti \u2261 97 %, Sigma Aldrich) as precursor, and distilled water (H2O) as oxidizing agent, at 225 \uff5eC. Ultrahigh purity nitrogen was used as reactant carrier and purge gas, and the reactor was maintained at 400 Pa."

The Cu2O\u6bcfGDEs contain 1 mg cm 2 of metal particles. The catalyst loading was kept at 1 mg cm 2 of Cu2O and 1 mg cm 2 of ZnO for the Cu2O/ZnO electrodes. These catalytic loading and weight ratio were observed to be the optimal for the reaction under study [11].

        "synthesis_paragraph": "The micro-strains inside the catalysts were introduced by a facile, fast cooling approach. In brief, copper oxide (CuO) nanoparticles were first synthesized and annealed at a high temperature (500 oC), and then was cooled down at different rates under various cooling environments (Figure 1a). For the super-fast cooling rate, the CuO nanoparticles were cooled in liquid N2 (?196 oC) to obtain the target catalyst, named CuO-FC (where FC indicates fast cooling rate). For comparison, the CuO nanoparticles were also cooled down by water (i.e., medium cooling rate, designated as CuO-MC) or hot air (i.e., slow cooling rate, designated as CuO-SC). The crystalline phases of these obtained samples were first characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Figure 2a). All the three samples presented sharp diffraction peaks that were characteristic for the crystal structure of monoclinic CuO (PDF: 89-5895). No clear 6 differences were observed in the peak positions. This result suggested that the different cooling treatments did not alter their phases or crystal structures. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed that all these CuO samples were composed of many interconnected irregularly nano-crystallines, with average sizes of ~ 50 nm (Figure 2b-d). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images exhibited similar nano-crystalline morphologies of these samples. However, a slight decrease of the particle size was observed with the increase of the cooling rate (Figure 2e-g, Figure S1). This slight reduction of particle size may be possibly ascribed to the fact that the fast cooling rate can limit the atomic transfer rate in the Ostwald Ripening process, and thus impede the material growth.27 In addition, many GBs were clearly observed in these small CuO nanoparticles. The CuO-FC sample presented a highest density of these GBs (as shown in red dashed box in Fig. 2g). As reported by previous literature,21 this high density of GBs was beneficial for transforming into a grainboundary-rich (GB-rich) Cu crystal structure during the subsequent electrochemical reduction of CuO. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was then conducted to further study the electronic structures of these samples. For the Cu 3d spectra (Figure 2h), the peaks at ca. 954.2 and 934.1 eV corresponded to the 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 of CuO.28 The three peaks of 962.3, 944.0 and 941.5 eV were assigned to the satellite signals of Cu2+.28 The O 1s spectrum can be de-convoluted into two distinct sub-peaks at 531.8 and 530.0 eV (Figure 2i), which were ascribed to the surface oxygen and lattice oxygen in CuO.29 The XPS results suggest that no clear electron transfer was observed between Cu and neighboring atoms.30 The atomic ratios between Cu and O elements in the three CuO samples were listed (Table S1). In addition, the ratios of the lattice oxygen and surface oxygen were 1.3, 1.33, and, 1.43, respectively (Table S2). The results indicated that no obvious oxygen vacancies existed, and were different from previous work of oxygen vacancies in TiO2.29, 31 This phenomenon difference can be attributed to the lower oxygen vacancy formation energy in TiO2.32 In addition, the lattice strains induced by alloying or lattice mismatch at epitaxial interfaces typically show an obvious shift of 7 the shell electron energy.33-35 However, the micro-strains are more associated with surface or bulk defects and thus do not present such a trend.36 To investigate the micro-strains by different cooling treatments, XRD collected using synchrotron light source (SXRD) was further conducted to measure these samples (Figure 3a-c). The two-theta XRD patterns derived from the SXRD results were displayed (Figure S2), and the plane distances were calculated by using Bragg equation 2dsin\u725f = n\u7af9, which were consistent with the results of the aforementioned 2- dimensional XRD (Figure 2a). The data of the SXRD were analyzed using Williamson?Hall analysis.18, 21 The scatters corresponded to each peak of the CuO samples were displayed (Figure 3d). A linear fitting was obtained and attributed to the following correlation: Bcos\u725f = K\u7af9/D + 4e*sin\u725f, where D is the average crystallite size, \u7af9 is the wavelength, e is the non-uniform strain (micro-strain), and the Scherrer constant K = 1.18, 21 The slopes of the linear fitting represented the micro-strains, and the crystallite sizes were calculated from the intercepts. The linear fitting results were summarized (Figure 3e), which showed an increasing slope with the cooling rate increase. Thus, CuO-FC exhibited the largest micro-strains. Meanwhile, CuO-FC also presented the largest intercept of the linear fittings, indicating the smallest crystallite size. The detailed fitting results of these three CuO samples were summarized (Table S3). The average sizes of the CuO-SC, CuO-MC and CuO-FC nanoparticles were 40.5, 35.8 and 35.3 nm, respectively. The effect of tuning the micro-strains and GBs in the CuO catalysts on the ECR performance was then investigated. Due to the low solubility of CO2 in aqueous solutions, the conventional H-type electrochemical cell can only have limited activities.37 In addition, the longer mass transportation path made the lower overpotential reaction of HER easier.38 Thus, the flow-cell with gas-diffusion layer (GDL) and high alkaline (1 M KOH) were used instead. About 0.25 mg\ufe5ecm-2 of CuO catalyst was loaded onto the GDL. Before the ECR measurement, all the three CuO catalysts were electrochemically reduced to form pure copper (Figure S3). TEM images show that all the Cu catalysts were homogeneously dispersed on the edge of 8 porous carbon (Figure S4). High-resolution TEM images show that there was little reconstruction of catalysts, with the GBs still being clearly observed. Different orientations of Cu (100) and (110) were observed (Figure S4d), suggesting that different crystallite domains co-existed to form micro-strains. The electrochemical performances of these samples were first investigated by measuring the cyclic voltammetry (CV) profiles. The results displayed characteristic peaks between ?0.3 and 0.5 V vs. RHE (Figure S5). The positive potential could be attributed to the reduce reaction of Cu2+ to Cu,38 and the negative potential was the water splitting into the hydrogen. The ECR activity was then measured under different applied potentials between ? 0.3 and ?1.2 V (vs. RHE, with iR-correction). For CuOSC, CuO-MC and CuO-FC, different products selectivity distribution of each electrocatalyst were displayed versus the applied potential (Figure 4a-c). The comparison of different samples was conducted within the limited potential difference. It can be seen that the H2 formation was maintained low with the FEs of < 20%, partially attributed to the pH effect in a high alkaline electrolyte.38 For all these three catalysts, CO, C2H4 and C2H5OH were the main ECR products. The ECR total current densities were close to 300 mA cm-2 at about ?1.0 V vs. RHE. The onset potentials of C2 products (C2H4 and C2H5OH) were relatively more negative than those of C1 products, as the C?C coupling process is generally more sluggish.40 The partial current densities of C2 products were 246.3 (for CuO-MC) and 240.8 mA\ufe5ecm-2 (for CuO-FC). The densities were 1.31 and 1.29 times higher than that of CuO-SC (186.9 mA\ufe5ecm-2). In addition, a clear difference of ethanol (C2H5OH) and ethylene (C2H4) was also observed. CuO-FC presented an FE as high as 35.7% for ethanol production with a partial current density of 127.2 mA\ufe5ecm-2. In contrast, CuO-MC exhibited an FE of only 18.6% for ethanol production, but with a partial current density of 179.9 mA\ufe5ecm-2 for producing ethylene (Table S4-S6). The Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) of the total C2 products of different samples were further plotted with the applied potentials (Figure 4d). When the potential was less negative than ?0.6 V, CuO-SC possessed a relatively high FE of C2 products. This is 9 because more unsaturated Cu sites in the smaller particle sizes of Cu-MC and Cu-FC resulted in higher H2 production at this potential range.41 At more negative applied potentials when the thermodynamic energy became more dominating for C?C coupling, both CuO-MC and CuO-FC showed better selectivities for C2 products at this potential range. The ratios between C2 and C1 products were displayed to show this trend (Figure 4e). In spite that CuO-FC had similar partial current densities for C2 formation as those of CuO-MC, the CuO-FC sample presented the largest ratios between C2 and C1 products in most of the potentials. For example, at ?0.8 V vs. RHE, the ratio between C2 and C1 products was 7.04 for CuO-FC, substantially exceeding that of CuO-MC (4.48) and CuO-SC (2.00). This clear increase of C2 product formation suggests that micro-strains induced by fast cooling rate can help to stabilize the main intermediate toward C2 production, that is, *CO,37 and thus the subsequent C?C coupling steps. Moreover, the ratios between ethanol and C2H4 products were further compared among these three catalysts (Figure 4f). It can be seen that CuO-FC presented the highest ratio between ethanol and C2H4, with a peak value of 1.4 at ?0.85 V vs. RHE. As suggested by recent literatures,42, 43 the improvement of *CO adsorption can lead to a higher surface coverage of *CO intermediate, favoring the subsequent oxygenate formation toward ethanol. To confirm our findings, we conducted another set of experiments by first reduced the CuO nanoparticles into Cu at high temperature, followed by fast cooling (using liquid nitrogen) or slow cooling (using natural room temperature), designated as CuFC and Cu-SC, respectively. XRD and corresponding Williamson-Hall analysis also demonstrated a similar trend that the Cu-FC obtained from fast cooling showed a higher density of micro-strains (Figure S6). The electrochemical CO2 reduction measurement using these catalysts demonstrated results of increased C2 products by fast-cooling Cu catalyst (Figure S7), similar to those of aforementioned CuO ones. Simultaneously, CuO (800)-FC was obtained by the same treatment with CuO annealed at 800 oC, which showed no obvious performance enhancement compared to CuO-FC (Figure S8). It demonstrated that a higher annealing temperature led a reduction of active sites.18"

The synthesis schematic diagram is shown in Fig. 1a. First, KBH4 is added into AgNO3, and the solution quickly turns black. After addition of Cu(NO3)2, the hydrogel is obtained by standing for 8 h, washed with water in depth and then dried by a freeze dryer to acquire bimetallic aerogel. Fig. 1b-d are scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of Ag100, Ag88Cu12 and Ag50Cu50, showing analogical porous structure, which indicates aerogel structure is not affected by metal ratio and can be universally feasible. The formation of these pores maybe caused by the large amount of overflowing H2 generated while reducing Ag+ and Cu2+ by KBH4. The three-dimensional porous network structure is the most important feature of aerogel materials[38] suggesting the successful preparation of our Ag-Cu bimetallic aerogel. Compared with onedimensional and two-dimensional materials, aerogel has unique advantages in catalysis. The large number of pores in Ag88Cu12 can supply more reaction sites for eCO2RR, and provide transfer channels for unreacted CO2 and generated CO to facilitate the diffusion of gas molecules, which favors its high activity and selectivity. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) further illustrates the successful synthesis of aerogel materials. Aerogel has three types of linkage: (1) bridge, applying to that the average size of the particle joint is smaller than the particle diameter, (2) ligament (size equal to the particle diameter) and (3) island (size larger than particle diameter)[39]. It is confirmed from Fig. 1e that Ag88Cu12 aerogel is composed of nanoparticles connected by ligaments with a porous network structure. As to the high-resolution TEM (Fig. 1f), it can be seen that a large number of grain boundaries are detected in the bimetallic aerogel. The lattice d-spacing of 0.232 nm corresponds to the face-centered-cubic structure of Ag(111)[40] which is further confirmed by the X-ray diffraction pattern (Fig. 2a), and the lattice d-spacing of 0.208 nm corresponds to the Cu(111)[38] (insert of Fig. 1f). STEM high-angle annular dark field-energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (HAADF-EDX) mapping pictures show that the distribution of Ag and Cu is uniform (Fig. 1g, Fig. S1). The value of BET specific surface area, pore volume and pore size of the bimetallic aerogel catalyst tested by liquid N2 adsorptiondesorption experiment can be seen in the Table S1. The BET surface area and pore size of Ag100, Ag88Cu12, and Ag50Cu50 are 3.04, 8.29, 9.25 m2 g 1 and 4.86, 5.49, 5.12 nm, respectively. Their nitrogen adsorption and desorption curves and pore size distribution are shown in Fig. S2."

Particles are designated as Cu1 (5 wt%), Cu2 (10 wt%), Cu3 (20 wt%), and Cu4 (30 wt%). The dried precursor was ground into a fine powder and reduced in a hydrogen environment (100 cc min 1) up to 250 C (ramp rate: 10 C min 1) for 2 h. The reduced powders were cooled to room temperature and the reaction chamber was sealed with Parafilm? and allowed to equilibrate with an oxygen containing environment (air) for 7 d. The reduced powders were combined with a potassium hydroxide solution (7 M, KOH pellets: EMD, 85%, 25 mL) and etched for 12 h.

The synthesis proceeded as follows: 3 mmol (0.605 g) of Cu(OAc)2\ufe5eH2O (OAc: acetate) and 2mmol (0.442 g) of trimesic acid (H3BTC: benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxilic acid, 0.40mmol) were hand-grinded thoroughly to obtain a homogeneous mixture, which was sealed in a 2-mL glass ampule and subsequently heated at 120 \uff5eC during 48 h using 2 \uff5eC/min heating ramp. The product was washed with methanol to remove unreacted reagents. Bi-based MOF, named as CAU-17, was prepared following the synthetic procedure described elsewhere [64]. Basically, Bi(NO3)3\ufe5e5H2O (1.03mmol) and H3BTC (1.17mmol) were added to a 70m L-teflon reactor along with 20mL of CH3OH, and heated to 120 \uff5eC in a microwave oven during 20min. The precipitate was filtered off, washed with methanol and dried at room temperature. MOF samples were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) on a Phillips X'PERT diffractometer (equipped with Cu-K\u6c50 radiation, \u7af9=1.5418 ?) over the range 5 < 2\u725f<70\uff5e with a step size of 0.02\uff5e at 293 K. The permanent porosity was studied by measuring N2 adsorption isotherms at 77 K using a Quantachrome Autosorb-iQ-MP analyzer. Microstructural features of MOFs and their dispersion were analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) using a JEOL JSM-7000 F microscope operated at 10\u6bcf20 kV. Specimens were mounted on conductive carbon adhesive tabs and imaged after chromium sputter coating of 5 nm to make them conductive."

In brief, GO-VB6 (10mg) was dispersed into the EG via sonication for 60min to form the homogeneous turbidity, and then the EG solution of Cu(NO3)2 was added dropwise. Next, N2H4?H2O was added under stirring. The molar ratio of N2H4?H2O to Cu2+ ions was 20:1. Finally, the reaction was conducted at 60 \uff5eC for 24 h. The obtained material was recovered by centrifugation, washed with the deionized water, and then dried in an oven at 40 \uff5eC. By changing the Cu (NO3)2 concentration, the materials with different intended Cu contents with 5%, 10%, 20% and 40% were obtained, donated as GO-VB6-Cu-1, GO-VB6-Cu-2, GO-VB6-Cu-3 and GO-VB6-Cu-4. In addition, the synthetic process of GO-Cu material with the Cu content of 10 wt% was similar with the above procedure, but using GO instead of GO-VB6."

Prior to the synthesis, the metal substrates (Cu foil, Ti Foil and Al foil supplied by Sigma Aldrich; Fe foil, Al grid and Fe-Cr-Ni alloy, supplied by Good-Fellow) were mechanically polished using a P280 abrasive sheet, then etched using an 0.5M HCl aqueous solution for 5min and finally washed with distilled water and dried. The pretreated substrates were thus used as the cathodes in a two-electrode electrochemical cell, while the anode was a Cu foil, which was pretreated using the same polishing and etching procedure. The two electrodes (cathode and anode) were fixed at a separation distance of 1 cm. A mixture of 0.4M Cu(CH3COO)2, 1.5M H2SO4 and 50mM HCl was used as the electrolyte [50]. The electrochemical deposition of Cu was performed under the application of a constant current (1.2 A) for times of 1, 2 and 4min. After the deposition, the materials were cleaned using distilled water, dried at 80 \uff5eC overnight and then calcined at 200 \uff5eC (5 \uff5eCmin?1 rate) for 1 h. The final supported Cu electrocatalyst appeared as a dark brown-black electrode. Similarly, Fe electrocatalysts were prepared on Fe, Fe-Cr-Ni alloy and Al substrates using 0.4 M FeSO4 (FeII) as the Fe precursor."

Importantly, unlike similar DC electrophoreticdissolution/deposition methods reported in the literature, no harsh and stringent variables were employed in the present synthesis. Typically, a copper rod with 6mm diameter (sacrificial anode) was first cleaned in 0.1 M HNO3 and rinsed thoroughly with deionised water. A platinum wire loop with 2mm diameter (deposition substrate cathode) was cleaned in 0.1 M HCl for 20 s and then rinsed thoroughly with water. Keithley 2231A-30-3 triple channel DC power supply from Tektronix Inc. USA that can be operated under constant voltage or current was used as a voltage source. The positive terminal was connected to copper rod whereas negative terminal was connected to Pt wire loop cathode immersed in a conventional glass electrochemical cell containing ascorbic acid solution in water and DC voltage was applied for the stipulated time interval. With time, the colour of the solution changes from colourless to pale blue (cyan) initially then to reddish brown suggesting the dissolution of metallic copper as copper ions into electrolyte solution followed by nucleation and growth of Cu-microstructures. Accumulation of a brownish mass of copper particles at the Pt cathode was also observed at a later part of the electrolysis. The obtained suspension was collected, centrifuged for 10min, washed with Milli-Q water several times followed by ethanol and then dried in a petri dish under vacuum at 50 \uff5eC for ca. 3 h. Several samples were prepared following the similar approach but varying the electrolysis parameters viz. applied voltage, L-ascorbic acid additive concentration, electrolysis time and temperature, one at a time. Based on the parameter of impact under consideration, four different batches of the deposits, with operations employed tabulated in Table SI-1 and described briefly as below were prepared."

Typically, a copper rod (6 mm diameter) polished with fine emery paper followed by 10 s immersion in 10% HNO3 and then rinsed several times with copious amount of acetone and deionised water was used as a sacrificial anode. Pt rod (0.2 mm diameter) or CFP (with 4 mm x 4 mm of surface area exposed to electrolyte) was used as collecting cathode (i.e. to deposit micro-CuxO composites). The electrodes were immersed in a conventional electrochemical cell containing continuously stirred aqueous tri-sodium citrate (200 mM) solution along with a known amount of GO aqueous suspension (0.3 mg/mL diluted from stock solution with concentration of 4 mg/mL) maintained at a constant temperature of ca. 40 \uff5eC (\u32a3 0.1 \uff5eC). A constant voltage was applied between Cu anode and Pt rod or CFP cathode using a Keithley (2231A-30-3) triple channel DC power supply (Tektronix)."

Four 25 cm2 GDLs (Sigracet, 39BCE) were fixed on a substrate using scotch tape and coated with the npCu/isopropyl alcohol suspension using a handheld airbrush (Fig. 1b and c). The manual airbrush technique used in this work resulted in non-uniform catalysts coatings as indicted by color variations of the coated GDL. The npCuGDL cathode assemblies were integrated into a 25 cm2 Opus 12 Inc. gas diffusion electrolyzer using an Aemion? AF1-HNN8? 50-X alkaline exchange membrane (AEM) (Ionomr Innovations Inc.) to separate the npCu-coated GDL cathode from the IrOx-coated porous Ti anode. The cell configuration is similar to that described in our previous work on CO2 to CO reduction using a nanoporous Au catalyst [30], and a schematic representation of the setup can be found in Fig. 1d. The cathode-AEM-anode assembly was then compressed between two flow fields against the respective cell current collectors. A CO2 flow rate of 250 sccm was used on the cathode side of the cell while 0.5 M KOH was circulated via a peristaltic pump on the anode side at 60 mL/min. Electrolysis was run in constant current mode with 35-minute holds at 25, 50, 75, 100, and 150 mA/cm2. The as-generated gas products were measured with an in-line gas chromatograph (GC, SRI 8610C) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) for measuring CO, CH4, C2H4, and H2 yields, respectively. The GC sampled the gas phase products every seven minutes and five data points were recorded for each current density. Here, we report the averaged selectivity and partial current densities (with the corresponding error bars) of the above GC-detected gas products. Liquid products are not reported here as the electrolyzer design used in this work did not allow for catholyte collection."

Cu(NO3)2 to Zn(NO3)2 molar percentage was 10 % (total 3.54 mmol). 2.301 g of 2-methylimidazole was added in 40 mL of methanol to form solution B. Then solution B was added to solution A with continuous stirring under the N2 atmosphere at room temperature and the reaction mixture was stirred for 90 min. The aging of the solution was done for 24 h. Then the precipitate was separated by centrifugation (3500 rpm, 15 min) and washed with methanol 3 times. After that, the material was dried in air overnight and then in a vacuum oven at 70 ?C for 24 h before further use. Samples were also prepared for the molar percentage of Cu(NO3)2 to Zn(NO3)2 of 20 % and 30 % using the same procedure."

All electrochemical experiments were performed using a CHI 660D electrochemical station (Shanghai Chenhua Instrument Co., Ltd.). 0.2 M KI aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte solution in all experiments. Typically, 10 mg mixture of MOF-199 and NG (mass ratio = 4:1) were dispersed uniformly in a solution containing 30 \u7c73L Nafion? 117 and 60 \u7c73L water by ultrasonication for 0.5 h. The suspension of MOF-199 and NG was coated on a carbon paper (area= 1.77 cm2), which was named MOF-199-NG/carbon paper. Then, Cu/ Cu2O@NG-2 was obtained by chronoamperometry at -1.9 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE) for 5 min by using the MOF199-NG/carbon paper as the working electrode, a platinum mesh as the counter electrode and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode. The potential in all the text was referred to RHE and determined using the following equation: E (vs. RHE) = E (vs. SCE) + 0.241 + 0.0591 \u2105 pH. The pH of the CO2-saturated KI solution (0.2 M) was 5.17. The synthetic process of Cu/Cu2O@NG-1 and Cu/Cu2O@NG3 was similar to the above procedure, except for the changes in the mass ratios of MOF-199 and NG (9:1, 7:3). Cu/Cu2O was also prepared with the same procedure, except that only MOF-199 was used as precursors."

A piece of the AAO membrane (used as a template) was 110 tightly stacked on the top of the Au foil and this AAO-masked Au 111 foil working electrode was sealed in a home-made electrode holder 112 (as shown in Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Material) with a cer- 113 tain exposed surface area of 0.985 cm 2 . Before the electrodeposi- 114 tion of Cu x Au y NWA, a thin layer of Au was galvanostatically pre- 115 electrodeposited at the current density of ?0.5 mA cm ?2 for 20 min 116 in a solution containing 0.02 M HAuCl 4 and 0.1 M ethylenediamine 117 on a CHI440C electrochemical workstation (Chenhua, China) to fill 118 the slight gap between the Au foil and AAO membrane. The so- 119 lution for the electrodeposition of Cu x Au y NWAs contained 0.02 M 120 CuSO 4 , 0.2 M glycine, 2 mM HAuCl 4 , and 10 mM ethylenediamine 121 [25] . The pH of the deposition solution was adjusted to \u20357.3 by 122 using 5 M NaOH solution. The Cu x Au y NWAs with various atomic 123 ratios of Cu and Au (i.e., CuAu, Cu 3 Au, and CuAu 3 NWAs) were fab- 124 ricated by using a potentiostatic pulse-electrodeposition method in 125 the same deposition solution but with different deposition param- 126 eters at 25 \uff5eC on an Autolab PGSTAT204 electrochemical worksta- 127 tion (Metrohm). Specifically, in a single cycle of the potentiostatic 128 pulse-electrodeposition of the CuAu NWA, the potential on the 129 working electrode was first set to ?0.45 V for 5 s, then the cell was 130 off for 10 s, and subsequently the potential on the working elec- 131 trode was driven to 0.001 V for 0.05 s. These three potential steps 132 were cycled for 3500 times to accomplish the electrodeposition of 133 the CuAu NWA. The Cu 3 Au and CuAu 3 NWAs were also grown by 134 using the potentiostatic pulse-electrodeposition method except for 135 that the first potential on the working electrode was set to ?0.5 136 and ?0.4 V and the number of the repeating cycles was 30 0 0 and 137 40 0 0, respectively. The Cu x Au y NWAs were fabricated by using the 138 AAO membrane as the sacrificial template, which was removed in 139 1 M NaOH solution after the electrodeposition. For comparison, the 140 Cu 3 Au film was electrodeposited in the same electrolyte at a con- 141 stant potential of ?0.5 V. 142 2.3. Physiochemical characterizations 143"

From SEM images, it was observed that nanospheres (for Cu and CuxZny), nanocubes (for Cu and CuxZny) and nanodendrites (for Cu) or nanocauliflowers (for CuxZny) were formed when the oxidation potential was changed from 0.7 V to 0.9 V, and 1.1 V, respectively. Surface roughness was increased when higher oxidation potential limits were applied to the electrodes during the oxidation-reduction treatment (nanocauliflowers~ nanodendrites > nanocubes > nanospheres). The production of C2+ compounds was showed to be influenced by the roughness factor, zinc content, and nanostructure shape. For a given shape, increasing the surface roughness factor led to higher FEs to C2+ compounds. The increase of zinc content in the polished flat electrodes showed to decrease the amount C2+ compounds produced. On the other hand, for OD-electrodes of a given shape, zinc content leads to a higher total FE for C2+. Although both roughness factor and catalyst alloy composition can impact the catalytic performance towards the production of C2+ compounds, the electrode nanostrucure shape showed to be the biggest factor in enhancing C2+ formation. Specifically, nanocube (which preferentially expose {100} facets) covered surfaces of Jo ur l P re -p ro"

        "synthesis_paragraph": "In a typical synthesis, 1 mmol CuCl2\ufe5e2H2O, 3 mmol thiourea (Tu), 2 mmol polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, MW = 40000), and 15 mL ethylene glycol (EG) were mixed in a three-neck flask. The mixture was heated to 150 \uff5eC and refluxed for 30 minutes, and then cooled to room temperature naturally. The dark green precipitate was washed with distilled water and ethanol for several times. The final product was obtained after being dried at 50 \uff5eC for 12 h in a vacuum oven. To control the product morphology and composition, the amount of Tu was reduced to 0.75 mmol or the reaction temperature was increased to 180 \uff5eC, while other conditions were kept the same. The structure characterization and electrochemical measurement were described in the Supplementary Materials. 3. Results and Discussion As shown in Fig. 1a, CuS nanoflowers composed of nanosheets were synthesized by solvothermal method at 150 \uff5eC in EG, with the feed ratio of Cu/S at 1:3. All the diffraction peaks in XRD pattern (Fig. 1b) can be indexed to the covellite CuS phase (PDF 06-0464). HR-TEM image shows the lattice spacing of the primary nanosheet in CuS nanoflowers was 2.8 ? (Fig. 1c), which matches the (103) plane of hexagonal covellite phase. Fig. 1d is the EDX spectra of CuS nanoflowers, demonstrating that they are comprised of Cu and S. To further identify the valence states of Cu and S, XPS analysis was performed. As shown in the Cu 2p XPS spectrum (Fig. 1e), the peaks at 932.5 eV and 952.5 eV can be assigned to Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2, together with the absence of shake-up satellite peaks, indicate Cu exists in +1 state. The S 2p peak can be deconvoluted to S2-, S2- and high valence S complex [13], respectively, as shown in Fig. 1f. The effect of Cu/S feed ratio and reaction temperature on copper sulfide formation were then 4 investigated. When Cu/S feed ratio was lowered from 1:3 to 1:0.75, copper sulfide with triangular plate morphology was formed (Fig. 2a). XRD analysis indicates other than covellite CuS, there also exists monoclinic Cu7S4 phase (PDF 23-0958), as shown in Fig. 2b. EDX measurement reveals that the average Cu/S atomic ratio of triangular plate was 1.45 (Cu1.45S). Furthermore, reaction temperature also influences copper sulfide formation. When the reaction temperature was increased from 150 \uff5eC to 180 \uff5eC, the obtained products maintain nanoflower-like morphology (Fig. 2c), but XRD analysis identified the existence of orthogonal Cu7S4 (PDF 33-0489) impurity phase (Fig. 2d). EDX result shows that the average Cu/S atomic ratio is 1.54 (Cu1.54S). These results indicate that both Cu/S feed ratio and reaction temperature are important experimental parameters for synthesizing pure covellite CuS nanoflowers. CuCl2 and Tu are known to form a Cu-Tu complex [14], which acts as actual precursor for synthesizing CuS under solvothermal conditions. Therefore, the Tu/Cu feed molar ratio should be high enough in order to obtain pure CuS phase, otherwise Cu-rich phase would be formed. In addition, high reaction temperature is required to pyrolyze Cu-Tu complex into CuS. However, when the reaction temperature exceeds certain threshold, due to the reducing power of EG, the formed CuS might be further reduced to Cu-rich phases such as Cu7S4, consistent with our previous observations [15]. The electrochemical performances of copper sulfides precatalysts in the CO2 reduction reaction were evaluated in an H-type cell (Fig. 3a) using a standard three-electrode system. Taking CuS nanoflowers as an example, they were first electrochemically reduced to SD-Cu, which showed very little morphological changes (Fig. S1). The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was then conducted on SD-Cu to evaluate its electrochemical activity. As shown in Fig. 3b, the current density in CO2-saturated 0.1 M KHCO3 was larger than that in N2-saturated solution, suggesting SD-Cu is more 5 favorable for CO2 reduction reaction than hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Under all applied potentials (-0.6 V, -0.8 V, -1.0 V and -1.2 V vs. RHE), the current densities displayed good stability (Fig. 3c). The performance of SD-Cu was quantitatively evaluated by calculating the FEHCOOH through analyzing the liquid-phase products after 2 h of potentiostatic electrolysis. From Fig. 3d, it can be seen that the FEHCOOH of SD-Cu originating from CuS nanoflowers can reach approximately 52% at -0.8 V ~ -1.0 V. In comparison, when Cu1.54S nanoflowers and Cu1.45S nanoplates were used as precatalysts, the FEHCOOH can only reach 37.5% and 24.2% (Fig. S2), respectively. Therefore, the selectivity of HCOOH depends both on the sulfur content and morphology of copper sulfides precatalysts. During the electrochemical reduction of copper sulfides to metallic Cu, S2- ions were released into the electrolyte and absorbed on the surface of Cu catalysts, which suppressed the formation of other hydrocarbon products and resulted in the high selectivity towards HCOOH during CO2 electroreduction [16]. The high S content in copper sulfides precatalysts might lead to more S2- ions absorbed on Cu surface and thus achieve higher FEHCOOH. To verify this hypothesis, we conducted a series of experiments using copper foil as the working electrode, with various amounts of K2S added in the KHCO3 electrolyte. It was found that the FEHCOOH of copper gradually increased with increasing K2S concentrations (Fig. S3). This is in agreement with the results that S-rich CuS has higher FEHCOOH compared to other Cu-rich copper sulfide counterparts. 4. Conclusions In summary, copper sulfide nanocrystals have been synthesized via a simple solvothermal method in ethylene glycol, with their morphology and composition varied by tuning the Cu/S feed ratio and reaction temperature. When being applied to the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to HCOOH, CuS nanoflowers exhibited the best FE (~ 52%) due to its high S content and specific morphology, 6 compared to their more Cu-rich counterparts. This study demonstrates copper sulfide composition and morphology are important tuning parameters for optimized HCOOH production via CO2 electrochemical reduction, which should be considered for future catalyst design.

The HRTEM images show the lattice fringes with the inter-fringe distance of 0.21 nm, corresponding to the (111) plane of the face-centered cubic (fcc) Cu. The multiple crystal domains and the surface disordering observed from the images also indicate the as-synthesized NPs are in polycrystalline and the surface Cu may have been oxidized."
